🧠 What We Know from All Yesterday’s Research (and Prior Runs):
🎯 Initial CPTS Scope (Blind AEN Box)
✅ External Scope:
🧱 One External IP Address

Usually hosting:

A web app (primary target)

MAYBE multiple virtual hosts or subdomains (via Host header)

One direct route to internal — either by shell OR proxy/tunnel

💡 Goal: Gain a shell on this external asset

Often a Linux web server

Sometimes a staging portal with misconfig or legacy flaw

✅ Internal Scope (Discovered After Pivot):
🔍 One or more internal subnets revealed post-initial access:

Often 172.16.x.x, 10.10.x.x, 192.168.x.x

Revealed via:

ifconfig / ip a

netstat / /etc/resolv.conf

hardcoded config in source code (web.config, .env, etc.)

captured creds from NFS, mount points, or tcpdump

💡 Key Targets Inside:

Windows dev boxes (dev01, etc.)

NFS shares or internal web apps

A Domain Controller (172.16.x.3 type of deal)

Eventually DA, secretsdump, trust abuse

🧰 Tools You Should Practice With in Simulated CPTS Environment:
Phase	Tool(s) to Use
Web Recon	ffuf, httpx, gau, nuclei, hakrawler
Initial Exploit	Manual payloads, php-rev-shell, curl, burp, etc.
Post-Access	ligolo-ng (preferred), chisel, proxychains
Internal Recon	nmap -e tun0, smbclient, ldapsearch, rpcclient
Windows Exploit	Evil-WinRM, CME, wmiexec.py, winPEAS.bat
AD Attack Pathing	SharpHound, BloodHound, mimikatz, Rubeus
Credential Replay	pth-winexe, secretsdump.py, impacket
🧪 Initial Access Vectors We've Seen in CPTS:
Vector	Description
WordPress RCE	Plugin abuse or upload bypass → revshell
SSRF to Local File Read	SSRF hits internal admin panel → leads to RCE or creds
SQLi → RCE	Auth bypass → xp_cmdshell or PHP injection
HTTP Verb Tampering	Bypass auth → admin panel → file upload
Session Hijack via XSS	Reflective → cookie steal + panel takeover
GitLab or Jenkins RCE	Internal dev portal exposed → default creds or RCE
💥 So your practice lab should mimic:
🔹 External Web Server (Linux):
Vuln Web App (WP/Joomla/custom)

Subdomains/vhosts

At least one hidden route or file

Goal: RCE or webshell

🔹 Internal Network (Post-Pivot):
Multiple hosts:

1-2 Windows Dev Machines (win10 or 2016)

1 NFS or file share box

1 Domain Controller

Possibly MGMT/Backup server

Path to DA:

Kerberoasting / ACL abuse / RBCD / DCSync

🛠 How to Simulate This Locally (Practice Setup Idea)
Set up one external Kali box w/ vulnerable web app (custom, DVWA, WP)

Simulate subdomains via /etc/hosts + Apache vhosts

Inside NAT, create:

Win10 or Win Server 2019 as dev01

Add 172.16.8.3 Domain Controller (AD setup)

Add NFS share or Samba share from another Linux box

Use Ligolo-ng or Chisel to simulate the tunnel between them
