🔁 1. Ligolo-ng (Pivoting Tool)
✅ Yes – test it now in HTB/AEN labs.

🔧 Install on HTB VM: You’ll need to build the relay and agent from source or grab prebuilt binaries from trusted GitHub releases.

🎯 Practice in any multi-host HTB box (like AEN labs) with internal IPs.

🛠️ Use-cases:

After getting initial shell, run agent on victim

Use the relay on HTB VM to create SOCKS5 tunnel

Use proxychains or socksified tools to access internal stuff

🧠 Practice Focus:

Use it to access internal services that would normally be blocked.

Practice autoroute feature (ligolo -add route 10.10.0.0/16).

🧨 Watch out: Some rooms don’t support reverse connections from inside boxes — test only on ones where you get full shell (not limited web shells).

⚔️ 2. NetExec (Lateral Movement)
✅ Yes – try it now, especially in AD-style HTB rooms.

🧱 NetExec is the active fork of CrackMapExec — faster and better maintained.

🔗 https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec

🛠️ Practice Tips:

Enumerate shares: nxc smb 10.10.X.X -u USER -p PASS --shares

Spray passwords: nxc smb 10.10.X.X -u USERLIST -p PASS

Gain shell: --exec-method smbexec/wmiexec

🔥 Test in HTB Academy AD boxes or rooms with real creds.

🧠 3. Obsidian Workflows
✅ Yes – clean up and restructure now.

While you're testing tools, log it all live in Obsidian:

📂 Suggested Folder Layout:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
/CPTS-Prep
    /Initial Access
    /Enumeration
    /Lateral Movement
    /Privilege Escalation
    /Pivoting
    /Tool Usage
    /Scripts
    /Methodologies
📋 Templates:

Add an “Exploit Template”:

markdown
Copy
Edit
## Exploit Name:
## Prerequisites:
## Detection:
## Steps Taken:
## Command Log:
## Output:
## Flags:
## Remediation:
🔗 Interlink: Link tools to techniques. e.g. [Ligolo-ng] inside a note about pivoting chains.

🧪 4. Custom Scripting
✅ Yes – start building + testing scripts now.

💡 Examples to start:

Subnet ping sweep

bash
Copy
Edit
for ip in $(seq 1 254); do ping -c1 10.10.10.$ip | grep "bytes from"; done
SMB Share Grabber:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./grab_shares.sh IP USER PASS
smbclient -L //$1 -U $2%$3
Quick Recon:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
host=$1
nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oA recon_$host $host
💾 Store them in /scripts in Obsidian, sync later to GitHub.

📽️ 5. Terminal Recording Tools (Asciinema & script)
✅ Yes – install and use now.

🔧 Install:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install asciinema
📹 Record:

bash
Copy
Edit
asciinema rec name_of_session.cast
Or use:

bash
Copy
Edit
script my_session.log
🧠 Practice Habit: Start recording as soon as you open a shell. Great for traceability and reports.

💡 Pro Tip: Set alias:

bash
Copy
Edit
alias record='asciinema rec ~/recordings/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M).cast'
⚠️ What to Hold Off Until Workhorse Arrives:
Tool / Action	Wait or Now?	Why
Ligolo on “personal” real targets	✅ Try now	But store configs for long-term later
Obsidian full restructuring	Start now	Move Obsidian Vault to external repo/USB when done
Big binary installations	Wait	Reduce clutter on shared HTB VM
Exported snapshots/OVA	Wait	Do this on your permanent Kali only
SysReptor (Reporting Tool)	Wait	Requires heavier setup & templates – better on main box
🐾 Your Move Right Now:
✅ Fire up HTB
✅ Clone & test Ligolo-ng and NetExec
✅ Build and log tiny scripts into Obsidian
✅ Start Obsidian restructure
✅ Record every lab session (asciinema or script)
✅ Export your HTB Obsidian Vault and Scripts to GitHub/GitLab or USB

When your new machine arrives, we’ll deploy everything cleanly and snapshot the “CPTS Master Setup.” 🔥
