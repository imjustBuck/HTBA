🚧 Getting Stuck: Roadblocks, Mental Loops & Tactical Recovery
One of the most under-discussed — but absolutely critical — aspects of the CPTS exam is dealing with cognitive friction. Getting stuck is not a fluke; it’s part of the challenge.
There will be moments when your usual logic fails, your recon returns noise, or your go-to exploits don’t work — and the exam starts to feel like a psychological endurance test.
Expect it. Plan for it. This section is here to help you build a mental defense layer for exactly those moments.

🔢 CPTS Roadblocks: Flag 1, 3 and 9
Some flags in CPTS are technical walls — they require chaining, lateral thinking, or multi-stage compromises. Others are psychological walls — they’re designed to break your rhythm and inject doubt into your process. Three flags stand out in both categories:

🧱 Flag 1 — The Cold Start Filter
Flag 1 is where many candidates stall for days. You’ll likely have dozens of services, paths, domains, and partial leads — but nothing just works.

It tests:

How you prioritize weak signals
Your willingness to go deeper, not broader
Your ability to revisit assumptions without spiraling
Why it hurts: You expect the first flag to be quick, a way to build momentum. Instead, it stops you cold. This triggers self-doubt early in the exam.

🧩 Flag 3 — The Puzzle
By the time you reach Flag 3, you likely have:

A shell (or two)
A few creds
A foothold in one segment

This flag challenges you to turn that foothold into lateral movement — often through a subtle privilege escalation vector, hidden share, or re-use of credentials on an unexpected protocol.
Why it hurts: You think you’ve done everything right — enumeration, privesc, loot — but still can’t move forward.

🔥 Flag 9 — The Mental Breaker
This is the exam’s “boss fight.” It’s not just about technical complexity — it’s about fatigue. If you’ve made it here, you’re likely 20+ hours deep, with tunnel vision creeping in.

Why it hurts: You’re technically capable of solving it, but your brain is fogged. You’re emotionally invested, sleep-deprived, and desperate for a win

🧠 Think Dumber: Simplify Before You Complicate
A common phrase echoed by CPTS veterans — and seen across Discord channels — is “Think dumber.” It doesn’t mean turning off your brain. It means resisting the urge to over-engineer.

🧩 Why We Overthink
The more technical you are, the more tempted you’ll be to:

Invent complex chains out of thin air
Assume everything is hardened unless proven otherwise
Start chaining ideas without testing the fundamentals
Often, the solution is dumb — a plaintext password in a config file, an overlooked share, a forgotten virtual host.

🛠️ Simplify Your Thinking With These

What’s the least privileged user I haven’t tested with?
Is there a low-hanging fruit I skipped because it seemed “too easy”?
If this were a real misconfigured network, where would a junior admin mess up?
Don’t be afraid to test the obvious:

Re-use credentials on RDP or WinRM
Try anonymous SMB
Look for creds in unattend.xml, .git, .env, or settings.php
Simplify first. Then escalate complexity.

🧰 My “Stuck” Toolkit
This is the toolkit I used whenever I felt like I had exhausted every option. Think of it as your “Break Glass in Case of Panic” strategy bank.

🔄 Tactical Steps for Reorientation

Re-enumerate everything from a new pivot.
New network access means new visibility. That one dead service from earlier? It might now be reachable.
Read your notes out loud.
This seems silly, but it activates your verbal processing and can trigger “wait a second…” moments.
Search the HTB Academy.
If you’re facing a situation you can’t recall a solution for, chances are the answer is somewhere in the path. Use keywords. Read the full content — not just the cheatsheets. All you need is in the Academy.
Sketch the attack surface.
Draw it on paper. VMs, users, IP ranges, trust paths. You’ll often spot missing links when you visualize.
Ask these two questions:
“What is this system trying to protect?”
“If I were an admin, where would I hide this misconfiguration?”
Turn off the monitor. Lie down. Walk through the flow mentally.
No distractions. Just you and your memory. This often resets stuck thinking.
Take a shower.
It sounds like meme advice — but I solved more than one flag mid-shampoo.
Why This Works
Getting stuck isn’t always a technical problem. It’s a cognitive bottleneck. You’re juggling:

Enumerated data
Half-executed ideas
Sleep deprivation
Impostor syndrome
Your job is to build routines that reset your mental stack. This toolkit is how you do that.

Checklist for safe ChatGPT use:

Use it to recall technique names or flags, not to generate critical attack steps.
Cross-check technical outputs (commands, syntax) with man pages or tool help menus.
If it dismisses a technique, verify with a second source before abandoning it.

🧠 I Think Differently Now
Before CPTS, I approached pentesting with a CTF mindset: binary challenges, point-and-shoot exploits, isolated problems. But CPTS changed that.
Now I see:

Infrastructure, not just hosts — each machine exists within a living ecosystem
Trust boundaries — who trusts what, and why, and how that can be abused
Misalignments between configuration and policy — where intentions fall short
Realistic attacker goals — not getting “root,” but reaching objectives quietly
It’s subtle, but it’s a seismic shift. I no longer see machines as challenges to solve — I see them as interfaces to the organization’s nervous system.
And that’s what real adversaries do.



🧰 The Tools I Built Became My Default Stack
I didn’t just “use” tools during CPTS — I built workflows and habits around them that now form the backbone of my daily red teaming work.

Obsidian: My entire methodology lives here. Organized, cross-linked, searchable, and persistent.
SysReptor: Faster than Word, cleaner than Markdown, and far more scalable for engagements.
Ligolo-ng: I don’t bother with Chisel unless I have to. Ligolo-ng is now my go-to tunneling solution for SOCKS5 chains, dynamic port forwarding, and multi-hop routes. Fast, stable, encrypted, and scriptable.
NetExec: The spiritual successor to CrackMapExec, and my constant companion for sweeping credentials, enumerating shares, and finding low-hanging fruit fast.
PowerView / BloodHound: Still unmatched for AD abuse — but now I don’t just trust edges, I validate them with PowerView and context-aware recon.

💼 Would I Recommend CPTS?
Yes — emphatically, but with caveats.
CPTS is not for beginners. It assumes:

You’ve done at least 30–40 real boxes (HTB, THM, VulnHub)
You know the basics of both Linux and Windows internals
You’ve touched Active Directory before
You understand the difference between a tool and a methodology
If you’re past that stage and want to:

Learn to think like a real internal attacker
Simulate full-scale AD compromises, privilege chains, and pivot tunnels
Build client-grade reports and deliverables
Move beyond “I got root” and into “this is a business risk”
Then CPTS is absolutely worth it.
🧠 And if you’re OSCP-certified? CPTS won’t necessarily be harder — but it will feel far more realistic. Less CTF. More client. More stress. More reward.
