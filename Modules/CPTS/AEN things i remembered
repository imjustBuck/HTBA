ok off rip, ffuf for all subdomains and or vHosts.. 
add to etc/hosts and a text file
run nmap on them all granted prolly gonna be the smae ports and protocols but for reporting its good
if we want to be lil extra run ffuf off the sub domains 
whatweb them subdomains and get that info  
ALSO dig axfr maindomain.com @<externalIP>   -> this will give us extra or confirm our findings 

eyewittness will prolly help too... initial access prolly gonna come from this... remember to like double or triple enumerate... if no easy wins... back to enumeration.
