🔥 Summary: Injecting Commands
Once you suspect Command Injection, your next step is testing it by trying to inject OS-level commands using chaining operators like ;, &&, or |. This section walks through:

Using the semicolon (;) to append a second command (whoami) after a safe input like an IP address.

Understanding that some validations only exist on the front-end (JavaScript in the browser), which you can bypass with tools like Burp Suite or ZAP.

Sending the payload manually to the back-end with custom HTTP requests.

If you get command output back (e.g., the username of the running process), that confirms successful command injection.

💡 Key Concepts + Patterns
🔹 Injection Chaining
You append a command to an otherwise safe command, e.g.:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping -c 1 127.0.0.1; whoami
Result: It pings localhost, then runs whoami.

Operator	Behavior
;	Always runs both commands
&&	Runs second only if first succeeds
`	
`	`
`cmd` or $(cmd)	Linux sub-shell execution
🔹 Client-Side Validation ≠ Security
Many apps use JavaScript-only checks to block things like semicolons or non-IP input.

You can bypass this using Burp or any HTTP client (e.g., curl, Postman).

Always test if back-end sanitization exists — if not, it’s wide open.

🔹 How to Confirm Injection
If your injected command:

Alters output

Prints system info (e.g., whoami, id, uname -a)

Echoes a known string

Then you’ve got injection.

🧠 ITTT Flow: Injecting Commands
IF:
You find an input form that looks like it's triggering system behavior (e.g. ping, traceroute, file creation)

THEN:
Test for command injection with simple payloads:

127.0.0.1; whoami

127.0.0.1 && id

127.0.0.1 | uname -a

Check if it blocks your input

If you get an error immediately (no network request) → likely front-end validation

Use Burp/ZAP to bypass

Intercept the request

Send to Repeater

Modify the input to inject your command

URL encode (CTRL+U) the payload if needed

Send and inspect the response

Look for command output

If you see system-level output (username, kernel, etc.) → ✅ Confirmed injection

🔍 Hidden Hints + Patterns
If the app accepts input like “IP”, “hostname”, “filename” or anything that “runs something” — always try injection.

Responses that include ping stats, file listing, or system info may leak hints about the back-end OS.

Watch for echoed output after your payload — that’s gold.

Combine with sleep or ping for blind injection (covered later).

🛠 Example Payloads to Try
Goal	Payload
Test if it injects	127.0.0.1; whoami
Time-based blind test	127.0.0.1 && sleep 5
Encode it	127.0.0.1%3Bwhoami
Print flag	127.0.0.1; cat /flag.txt
Subshell test	127.0.0.1$(whoami) or 127.0.0.1`whoami

🧪 Command Injection Flow — Straight Shooter Style:
See a textbox / input field
🔎 Ask: "Is this interacting with the system somehow?"
(e.g., pings, file actions, hostname lookups)

Initial Payload Test
✅ Input:

127.0.0.1; whoami

; echo test

& id
👀 Watch output — did it change?

Blocked?

If you see a frontend error (no network request):
👉 JavaScript validation — bypass with Burp.

Use Burp Suite / ZAP

Intercept request

Toss in payload (URL-encode if needed)

Send from Repeater

Check response

Confirm Injection

Output includes OS info (user, kernel, path, etc.)

BOOM 💥 confirmed vuln

🧠 Quick Tips
If the output is suppressed or empty, try:

; echo pwned

; whoami > /tmp/test.txt + download

Time delay (blind test): ; sleep 5

Windows boxes?

Use && whoami, & whoami, echo PWN
