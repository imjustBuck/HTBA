One of the best places to look for privilege escalation is the processes that are running on the system. Even if a process is not running as an administrator, it may lead to additional privileges. The most common example is discovering a web server like IIS or XAMPP running on the box, placing an aspx/php shell on the box, and gaining a shell as the user running the web server. Generally, this is not an administrator but will often have the SeImpersonate token, allowing for Rogue/Juicy/Lonely Potato to provide SYSTEM permissions.

Access Tokens
In Windows, access tokens are used to describe the security context (security attributes or rules) of a process or thread. The token includes information about the user account's identity and privileges related to a specific process or thread. When a user authenticates to a system, their password is verified against a security database, and if properly authenticated, they will be assigned an access token. Every time a user interacts with a process, a copy of this token will be presented to determine their privilege level.

Enumerating Network Services
The most common way people interact with processes is through a network socket (DNS, HTTP, SMB, etc.). The netstat command will display active TCP and UDP connections which will give us a better idea of what services are listening on which port(s) both locally and accessible to the outside. We may find a vulnerable service only accessible to the localhost (when logged on to the host) that we can exploit to escalate privileges.

The main thing to look for with Active Network Connections are entries listening on loopback addresses (127.0.0.1 and ::1) that are not listening on the IP Address (10.129.43.8) or broadcast (0.0.0.0, ::/0). The reason for this is network sockets on localhost are often insecure due to the thought that "they aren't accessible to the network." The one that sticks out immediately will be port 14147, which is used for FileZilla's administrative interface. By connecting to this port, it may be possible to extract FTP passwords in addition to creating an FTP Share at c:\ as the FileZilla Server user (potentially Administrator).

More Examples
One of the best examples of this type of privilege escalation is the Splunk Universal Forwarder, installed on endpoints to send logs into Splunk. The default configuration of Splunk did not have any authentication on the software and allowed anyone to deploy applications, which could lead to code execution. Again, the default configuration of Splunk was to run it as SYSTEM$ and not a low privilege user. For more information, check out Splunk Universal Forwarder Hijacking and SplunkWhisperer2.

Another overlooked but common local privilege escalation vector is the Erlang Port (25672). Erlang is a programming language designed around distributed computing and will have a network port that allows other Erlang nodes to join the cluster. The secret to join this cluster is called a cookie. Many applications that utilize Erlang will either use a weak cookie (RabbitMQ uses rabbit by default) or place the cookie in a configuration file that is not well protected. Some example Erlang applications are SolarWinds, RabbitMQ, and CouchDB. For more information check out the Erlang-arce blogpost from Mubix

Named Pipes
The other way processes communicate with each other is through Named Pipes. Pipes are essentially files stored in memory that get cleared out after being read. Cobalt Strike uses Named Pipes for every command (excluding BOF). Essentially the workflow looks like this:

Beacon starts a named pipe of \.\pipe\msagent_12
Beacon starts a new process and injects command into that process directing output to \.\pipe\msagent_12
Server displays what was written into \.\pipe\msagent_12
Cobalt Strike did this because if the command being ran got flagged by antivirus or crashed, it would not affect the beacon (process running the command). Often, Cobalt Strike users will change their named pipes to masquerade as another program. One of the most common examples is mojo instead of msagent. One of my favorite findings was finding a named pipe start with mojo, but the computer itself did not have Chrome installed. Thankfully, this turned out to be the company's internal red team. It speaks volumes when an external consultant finds the red team, but the internal blue team did not.

More on Named Pipes
Pipes are used for communication between two applications or processes using shared memory. There are two types of pipes, named pipes and anonymous pipes. An example of a named pipe is \\.\PipeName\\ExampleNamedPipeServer. Windows systems use a client-server implementation for pipe communication. In this type of implementation, the process that creates a named pipe is the server, and the process communicating with the named pipe is the client. Named pipes can communicate using half-duplex, or a one-way channel with the client only being able to write data to the server, or duplex, which is a two-way communication channel that allows the client to write data over the pipe, and the server to respond back with data over that pipe. Every active connection to a named pipe server results in the creation of a new named pipe. These all share the same pipe name but communicate using a different data buffer.

We can use the tool PipeList from the Sysinternals Suite to enumerate instances of named pipes.

After obtaining a listing of named pipes, we can use Accesschk to enumerate the permissions assigned to a specific named pipe by reviewing the Discretionary Access List (DACL), which shows us who has the permissions to modify, write, read, or execute a resource. Let's take a look at the LSASS process. We can also review the DACLs of all named pipes using the command .\accesschk.exe /accepteula \pipe\.

Named Pipes Attack Example
Let's walk through an example of taking advantage of an exposed named pipe to escalate privileges. This WindscribeService Named Pipe Privilege Escalation is a great example. Using accesschk we can search for all named pipes that allow write access with a command such as accesschk.exe -w \pipe\* -v and notice that the WindscribeService named pipe allows READ and WRITE access to the Everyone group, meaning all authenticated users.

Checking WindscribeService Named Pipe Permissions
Confirming with accesschk we see that the Everyone group does indeed have FILE_ALL_ACCESS (All possible access rights) over the pipe.

GPT Summary 

✅ Summary — “What’s This Section Teaching Me?”
This section teaches you:

How to identify processes and communication channels (network ports + named pipes)

How to map access tokens and privileges of processes

How to spot local services that may be exploitable (even if they aren’t running as admin)

How to use tools like netstat, pipelist, and accesschk to find opportunities

And ultimately: How to move from low-priv to SYSTEM by targeting local services or inter-process comms

The key point:

🧠 You don’t always need to be admin to escalate — sometimes a web server, named pipe, or token with the right permission is enough.

🔀 Workflow — Got This? Do That (Windows PrivEsc: Process Comms Edition)
markdown
Copy
Edit
### 🧠 Got Initial Shell? Here's What to Check for Process-Based PrivEsc:

1. 🔍 Run `netstat -ano`
   - Look for ports bound to **127.0.0.1** or **::1**
   - Identify which PID owns that socket
   - Use `tasklist /FI "PID eq <PID>"` to find the process name
   - Investigate any web servers (e.g., IIS, XAMPP, FileZilla) or **internal admin interfaces**

2. 🔎 Use `pipelist.exe` or `gci \\.\pipe\` to enumerate Named Pipes
   - Look for **non-standard names** like `WindscribeService`, `mojo`, `msagent_12`
   - Look for pipes **mimicking other tools** (CobaltStrike often does this)

3. 🛑 Run `accesschk.exe /accepteula \\.\pipe\<pipe_name> -v`
   - You're looking for:
     - `RW Everyone`
     - `FILE_ALL_ACCESS`
     - Any **overly permissive ACLs** (DACLs)

4. 🧪 Identify the token privileges available
   - Use tools like **TokenViewer**, **whoami /priv**, or **Windows Exploit Suggester**
   - Check for tokens like `SeImpersonatePrivilege` or `SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege`
   - If found: test **JuicyPotato**, **RoguePotato**, **PrintSpoofer**, etc.

5. 🔥 Found a service like FileZilla or Splunk?
   - Search for default configs (no auth? default creds?)
   - Exploit misconfig (e.g., write to FTP root as SYSTEM)
   - Research known local CVEs (check Rapid7, ExploitDB, GitHub)

🧠 If This, Then That — Exploitation Decision Flow
If You See	Then Consider
127.0.0.1:14147 (FileZilla Admin)	Can you connect? Upload a shell? Grab stored creds?
netstat shows Splunk service	Is it SYSTEM? Does it allow config deployment? Try SplunkWhisperer2
Port 25672 open (Erlang)	Try default cookie, check configs (RabbitMQ, CouchDB)
Named Pipe with Everyone RW	Run accesschk, look for FILE_ALL_ACCESS, attempt abuse
Pipe name mimics browser (mojo, chrome)	Check if red team is active, or if it's a backdoor
You have SeImpersonatePrivilege	Try JuicyPotatoNG, PrintSpoofer, or RoguePotato
A web service is bound to localhost only	Can you port-forward it? Use chisel, plink, PowerCat, or SSH
🧩 Patterns & Red Flags (Train Your Instincts)
Loopback-bound services (127.0.0.1) often skip authentication or expect trust

Unusual ports like 14147, 8080, 47001 — check them in the browser or curl locally

Cobalt Strike pipes often start with msagent_, mojo_, post_

SYSTEM-owned processes running common software = jackpot (Splunk, FileZilla, etc.)

Services without authentication running as SYSTEM = easy PrivEsc

Named Pipes with open perms = HUGE red flag

FileZilla especially = often SYSTEM and zero auth on admin GUI
