✅ Summary — What This Section Is Teaching You
This section gives you a crash course on how Windows handles privilege assignment and checks for local/system/domain-level actions. Key takeaways:

Privileges ≠ permissions — they’re not about files, they’re about what actions a user can perform on the system itself.

Privileges are bundled into access tokens upon login and are usually disabled by default, even for Admins.

Group membership can implicitly assign privileges — and even non-Admins may hold powerful rights.

Knowing what user rights are present = knowing what escalation paths are open.

Privilege checks are governed by SIDs, tokens, DACLs/ACEs, and user rights assignments.

Tools like whoami /priv reveal the hidden powers a user has but may not yet be using.

Detection can be tied to Event ID 4672, which logs assignment of special privileges on new sessions.

This section lays the foundation for token abuse, Potato attacks, driver-based escalation, and more.

🔀 Workflow — Got This? Do That (Windows Privilege Enumeration & Escalation)

## 🎯 Got Access to a Shell? Here's the Privilege Workflow:

1. 🧾 Run `whoami /priv` to see assigned privileges
   - Pay close attention to:
     - SeImpersonatePrivilege ✅ (Potato Attacks)
     - SeDebugPrivilege ✅ (Inject into other processes)
     - SeLoadDriverPrivilege ✅ (Driver-based PrivEsc)
     - SeBackupPrivilege ✅ (NTDS.dit/SAM shadow copy attacks)
     - SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege ✅ (Hijack permissions)
     - SeRestorePrivilege ✅ (Privilege abuse to overwrite files)
     - SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege ✅ (Junction/hard link abuse)

2. 🔎 Check `whoami /groups` and `net localgroup <group>` to find elevated memberships
   - Are you in: **Backup Operators**, **Print Operators**, **Remote Management Users**, etc.?

3. 🧠 Compare `whoami /priv` across user types:
   - Low-priv user = minimal rights (maybe just `SeChangeNotify`)
   - Admin (non-elevated) = more assigned, still disabled
   - Admin (elevated) = full suite unlocked

4. ⚙️ Enable disabled privileges (if needed)
   - Use custom PowerShell scripts or API wrappers (since there's no built-in cmd to enable)

5. 🎯 Research any rights you find
   - What abuse is possible with it?
   - Is there a known attack chain for this privilege or group?

🧠 If This, Then That — Privileges & Abuse Paths
If You Have This Privilege	Then You Can Likely Abuse It With
SeImpersonatePrivilege	Juicy/Rogue/PrintSpoofer (token impersonation → SYSTEM)
SeDebugPrivilege	Inject into SYSTEM process (e.g., LSASS), or dump creds
SeBackupPrivilege	Use VSS or raw disk access to extract SAM/NTDS/registry hives
SeRestorePrivilege	Restore privileged files to escalate (overwrite protected files)
SeLoadDriverPrivilege	Load malicious kernel drivers (careful — may crash or bluescreen)
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege	Take ownership of protected files, then add rights
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege	Spawn SYSTEM processes using tokens
SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege	Abuse junction/hard link attacks on service installs or backups
Group: Backup Operators	You can extract sensitive files, cause DC downtime, and backdoor systems
Group: Print Operators	Abuse driver load to gain SYSTEM
Group: Hyper-V Administrators	Compromise VM-based Domain Controllers
Group: DNS Admins	Drop DLLs into DNS service (persistence + possible SYSTEM if rebooted)
🧩 Patterns & Enumeration Hints (Build Intuition)
🔍 Always run whoami /priv and whoami /groups early — even low-priv users might surprise you.

🔐 Most powerful tokens are assigned but disabled — they look harmless but can be enabled.

🎭 Membership in “Backup Operators” or “DNS Admins” = don’t overlook — they’re privilege gold mines.

⚠️ Low-priv users in weird groups (like Remote Management Users) are often accidental backdoors.

🔁 Even if you’re not in Admins — token privileges might let you act like one.

🛠️ Tools / Commands Cheat Sheet
Command	Purpose
whoami /priv	See assigned privileges (enabled & disabled)
whoami /groups	Check group membership (impacts privilege inheritance)
net user <user>	Look for group memberships, account info
net localgroup <group>	See all members of a local group (especially Administrators, RDP Users)
Event ID 4672	Log of “special privileges” assigned to a new logon
🔐 Detection & OPSEC
Privilege escalation via token abuse or driver loading will trip alerts on well-monitored systems.

Look for Event ID 4672 — security teams often monitor this for anomalies.

Running whoami /priv itself is noisy in high-alert environments (especially with red teams present).

UAC may block certain rights even if they’re assigned — admin ≠ elevated, remember that.
