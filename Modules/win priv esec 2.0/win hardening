🛡️ Windows Hardening – "Got This, Do That"
✅ Got a Windows environment to secure?
🔐 Do This: Build your defense from the ground up.

1️⃣ Got freshly imaged or new systems?
🔧 Do This: Create a secure custom base image
Build from clean ISO

Include only approved, essential apps

Strip away bloatware & trialware

Bake in:

Configured group policies

SCCM/WDS if available

Tested updates (major/minor)

🧠 Think of it like a hardened mold for every future workstation/server.

2️⃣ Got inconsistent patching?
🔄 Do This: Patch management strategy
Use Update Orchestrator to auto-apply updates.

Enterprises → Use WSUS to centralize update management.

Test first, then deploy company-wide.

Reboot often to finalize patches.

🔄 Patch flow: Scan → Decide → Download → Install → Reboot = Secure

3️⃣ Got policy sprawl or config chaos?
🏗️ Do This: Use Group Policy (GPO)
Centralized config management in AD

Lock down:

Windows Defender behavior

Updates

User privileges

Browser settings

Apply local GPOs for standalone hosts

🎯 Tip: Plan GPOs carefully — a bad one can brick thousands of endpoints.

4️⃣ Got too many users or local admins?
👥 Do This: Tighten User Management
Minimize admin accounts

Review group memberships (no devs in Domain Admins!)

Enforce:

Password history

Length & complexity

Expiry/rotation

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

🔐 2FA = something you know + something you have

5️⃣ Got no visibility into config drift or vulnerabilities?
📋 Do This: Audit the environment
Use:

DISA STIGs

Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit

Frameworks: ISO27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA

Use STIG Viewer to step through secure baselines

Validate your config against known-good policies

⚠️ These are guides, not full security programs. Tailor to your org’s mission.

6️⃣ Got poor visibility or no logs?
📊 Do This: Implement proper logging
Use Sysmon:

Tracks processes, network, logins, file mods

Ships to SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel)

Collect logs from:

Hosts (Sysmon/Event Logs)

Network (Security Onion, PacketBeat, IDS/IPS)

Tune alerts for real threats

🧠 “Logs without correlation are just noise.”

7️⃣ Got excessive attack surface or misconfigurations?
🔒 Do This: Apply hardening basics
Enable:

Secure Boot

BitLocker

Credential Guard

Device Guard

Audit:

Writable folders (C:\Scripts)

Unquoted service paths

Scheduled tasks running elevated

Clean up:

Cleartext creds

PS history

Unused tools or legacy services

⚠️ Got multiple departments, apps, or legacy systems?
💡 Don’t blindly apply STIGs or hardening checklists.

🧠 Do This: Context-driven security
Understand your business risk

Map controls to what you protect (PHI, finance, IP)

Balance security vs. usability
