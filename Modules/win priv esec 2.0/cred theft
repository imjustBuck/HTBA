🔐 Summary: Further Credential Theft
This section expands on how attackers can extract stored credentials beyond typical plaintext files, diving into saved credentials across tools, browsers, registries, and Windows features. Key areas include:

cmdkey stored RDP credentials

Browser credential storage (Chrome, via SharpChrome)

Password managers like KeePass (.kdbx cracking with keepass2john and Hashcat)

Email hunting with MailSniper

LaZagne to mass extract saved creds across applications

SessionGopher for decrypting saved SSH/RDP sessions

Registry-stored credentials (AutoLogon, PuTTY)

Wi-Fi passwords stored on the host

🧠 Patterns & Hints
🧠 Privs matter – Many tools (LaZagne, SessionGopher) will yield more when run as local admin or SYSTEM.

🧠 Persistence trail – Users reuse passwords across browser creds, RDP, KeePass vaults, etc.

🧠 Unsecured storage – Tools like PuTTY and AutoLogon often keep creds in plaintext.

🧠 Think lateral – Stored RDP creds and Wi-Fi keys often give access beyond the current system.

⚙️ "Got This, Do That" Decision Flow
🎯 Scenario: You land on a box with user-level access
Got This	Do That
🟢 You see stored RDP sessions	cmdkey /list → runas /savecred to attempt lateral movement
🟢 Chrome is installed	Run SharpChrome.exe logins /unprotect to extract browser credentials
🟢 KeePass .kdbx file found	keepass2john.py → hashcat -m 13400 with RockYou or hybrid list
🟢 PowerShell script with .xml creds	Import-Clixml → .GetNetworkCredential().Password
🟢 User is logged in to Exchange	Use MailSniper to search inbox for keywords like "password"
🟢 Admin or local access to PS session	.\lazagne.exe all or targeted modules (e.g., windows, browsers)
🟢 RDP, PuTTY, WinSCP saved sessions	Use SessionGopher.ps1
🟢 Access to registry (HKCU/HKU)	Query keys for AutoLogon, PuTTY, and plaintext values
🟢 Wireless interface on host	netsh wlan show profile → netsh wlan show profile <SSID> key=clear
