Ffuf is pre-installed on your PwnBox instance. If you want to use it on your own machine, you can either use "apt install ffuf -y" or download it and use it from its GitHub Repo(https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf.git). As a new user of this tool, we will start by issuing the ffuf -h command to see how the tools can be used:

Directory Fuzzing
As we can see from the example above, the main two options are -w for wordlists and -u for the URL. We can assign a wordlist to a keyword to refer to it where we want to fuzz. For example, we can pick our wordlist and assign the keyword FUZZ to it by adding :FUZZ after it:

SYNTAX: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ
