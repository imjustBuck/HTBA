Extension Fuzzing
In the previous section, we found that we had access to /blog, but the directory returned an empty page, and we cannot manually locate any links or pages. So, we will once again utilize web fuzzing to see if the directory contains any hidden pages. However, before we start, we must find out what types of pages the website uses, like .html, .aspx, .php, or something else.

One common way to identify that is by finding the server type through the HTTP response headers and guessing the extension. For example, if the server is apache, then it may be .php, or if it was IIS, then it could be .asp or .aspx, and so on. 

SYNTAX: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/indexFUZZ

Page Fuzzing
We will now use the same concept of keywords we've been using with ffuf, use .php as the extension, place our FUZZ keyword where the filename should be, and use the same wordlist we used for fuzzing directories:

SYNTAX: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://83.136.249.104:47483/blog/FUZZ.php

CHALLENGE : 


Question 1 - Try to use what you learned in this section to fuzz the '/blog' directory and find all pages. One of them should contain a flag. What is the flag? - HTB{bru73_f0r_c0mm0n_p455w0rd5}
 
1) ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://83.136.249.104:47483/blog/FUZZ.php
2) output shows us another page called home 
3) go to http://83.136.249.104:47483/blog/home.php
4) find flag on homepage - HTB{bru73_f0r_c0mm0n_p455w0rd5}
