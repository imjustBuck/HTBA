In ffuf, we can enable recursive scanning with the -recursion flag, and we can specify the depth with the -recursion-depth flag. If we specify -recursion-depth 1, it will only fuzz the main directories and their direct sub-directories. If any sub-sub-directories are identified (like /login/user, it will not fuzz them for pages). When using recursion in ffuf, we can specify our extension with -e .php

Note: we can still use `.php` as our page extension, as these extensions are usually site-wide.

Finally, we will also add the flag -v to output the full URLs. Otherwise, it may be difficult to tell which .php file lies under which directory.


SYNTAX: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://83.136.249.104:47483/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v

key is the recursion depth... do we want to look back 1 pages , or 3 

CHALLENGE: 

Question 1 - Try to repeat what you learned so far to find more files/directories. One of them should give you a flag. What is the content of the flag? - HTB{fuzz1n6_7h3_w3b!}
