‚úÖ Summary
This section focuses on manual post-exploitation Linux enumeration, teaching you how to identify OS details, kernel version, users, services, and misconfigurations that can lead to privilege escalation. While tools like LinPEAS and LinEnum are helpful, understanding the why and how behind each check is essential for the CPTS exam and real-world red team ops.

üîÄ "If This, Then That" Workflow
Got This	Then Do That
‚úÖ Shell Access	Run basic situational awareness commands: whoami, id, hostname, ip a, sudo -l
Found OS Version	Look up known vulnerabilities for that distro + version
Found Kernel Version	Check ExploitDB or searchsploit for kernel exploits (but beware of crashes in prod!)
PATH misconfigured	Look for writable folders early in the path to exploit PATH hijacking
Found services running as root (e.g., Samba, Nagios)	Look up known local privilege escalations
Found /etc/passwd or group info	Identify interesting users (e.g., devs, admins, backups) and see if they reuse creds or have readable home dirs
Found .bash_history, config files, or SSH keys	Extract them and look for plaintext creds or pivot/persistence ops
sudo -l returns command(s)	Check GTFOBins or test running those commands to escalate to root
/etc/fstab, /etc/mtab, df -h, or lsblk show interesting mounts	Look for creds, backup data, or sensitive files on mounted/unmounted partitions
Found hidden dirs/files in /tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm	Check for leftover exploit files, creds, or running processes
Found interesting entries in /etc/resolv.conf or route	Indicates domain environment ‚Äì consider AD enumeration next
LinPEAS output available	Correlate with manual checks; don‚Äôt rely on it blindly
üß† Patterns / What to Look For
OS and kernel versions that are outdated = potential kernel LPE

Services running as root = big attack surface (check CVEs)

Users with Bash or SH shells = potential login accounts

Environment variables leaking sensitive info (env)

Weak sudo permissions (e.g., sudo less, sudo vi) = GTFOBins win

Misconfigured PATH = command injection via path hijack

Hidden .ssh, .git, .wget-hsts, .notes, .bash_history files

Writable temp folders or mounted media = creds, scripts, sensitive data

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Commands
Purpose	Command
Basic Identity	whoami, id, hostname
OS Info	cat /etc/os-release, uname -a, cat /proc/version
Kernel Info	uname -r, searchsploit linux kernel <version>
Network Info	ip a, route, netstat -rn, arp -a
PATH & Env Vars	echo $PATH, env
Mounted Disks	df -h, mount, lsblk, cat /etc/fstab
User Info	cat /etc/passwd, grep sh$ /etc/passwd, cat /etc/group, getent group sudo
Hidden Files	find / -type f -name ".*", find / -type d -name ".*"
Home Dirs	ls /home, ls -la /home/<user>
Temporary Files	ls -l /tmp /var/tmp /dev/shm
Automation (post-manual)	linpeas.sh, linenum.sh (store outputs)
üí• Hints / Gotchas / Exam Tips
Don‚Äôt skip manual checks just because LinPEAS exists. You‚Äôll build better instincts by practicing enumeration manually.

sudo -l is often the fastest way to escalate ‚Äî always check it early.

Pay attention to .bash_history and .ssh directories ‚Äî gold mines.

Don't sleep on the /etc/fstab, .conf, and temp directories ‚Äî they hide secrets.

In client reports, screenshot uname -a, whoami, sudo -l, etc. to prove RCE and environment details.

Always assume you‚Äôll have to adapt your commands per distro/version ‚Äî test and verify outputs.

If no easy win: go back and re-enumerate. You probably missed something.
