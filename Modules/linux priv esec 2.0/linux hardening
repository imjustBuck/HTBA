🔐 Linux Hardening – "If This, Then That" Breakdown
✅ IF YOU WANT TO PREVENT EASY PRIVESC VECTORS →
THEN DO THIS: Regular Updates & Patching

Why? Kernel exploits (like DirtyPipe or Netfilter) often target unpatched systems. Keeping the system current eliminates a lot of low-hanging fruit.

Tool:

Debian/Ubuntu: unattended-upgrades

Red Hat: yum-cron

If you find uname -r showing something ancient → potential exploit.

✅ IF YOU’RE LOCKING DOWN FILES/BINARIES →
THEN DO THIS: Config Management + SUID/Cron/Sudo Checks

Checklist:

find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null → scan SUID binaries.

ls -la /etc/cron* → check cron files for writable perms.

sudo -l → ensure binaries use absolute paths (to prevent hijacks).

grep -i password /etc/* → find plaintext creds.

ls -la ~/.bash_history → avoid exposed command history.

Best Practices:

Remove unused packages/services.

Ensure custom libraries are not world-writable.

Use SELinux or AppArmor for extra policy enforcement.

✅ IF YOU WANT TO TIGHTEN USER CONTROL →
THEN DO THIS: User Management + Password Policy

Checklist:

Enforce password history w/ /etc/security/opasswd

Rotate passwords + check with chage -l <user>

Remove unused users from /etc/passwd

Audit group membership: groups <user>

Restrict sudo: visudo + use NOPASSWD sparingly.

Tools:

Config mgmt like Puppet, SaltStack, Ansible

Slack/email integrations for live alerts on changes

✅ IF YOU WANT TO VALIDATE SECURITY BASELINES →
THEN DO THIS: Audit w/ Lynis

Steps:

Clone and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis.git
cd lynis
./lynis audit system
Look for:

🔺 Warnings (bad perms, missing sync, etc.)

💡 Suggestions (e.g., "Set GRUB password", "Disable core dumps")

Review the:

lynis-report.dat (scan output)

lynis.log (full detail)

Bonus Tip: Run Lynis as root to unlock more checks.
Non-priv mode is good, but full mode = beast mode.

🔄 Recap Cheat Sheet:
If You See	Then Consider
Old kernel or sudo version	Public exploit like DirtyPipe or CVE-2021-3156
Writable custom libs	LD_PRELOAD or .so hijack risk
Unlocked cron or tmp dirs	Script injection or binary planting
sudo -l shows env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD	Easy privesc if you can drop .so file
User has access to /usr/lib/pythonX.X/	Python module hijack possible
SUID binary calls a custom lib	Shared object hijack time
/etc/passwd has no root password hash	DirtyPipe style root access
pkexec is present on vulnerable Polkit	Run CVE-2021-4034 PoC
/etc/sudoers lets you run specific commands	Try sudo -u#-1 <cmd> (CVE-2019-14287)
💥 Real-World Insight for Reporting (Bonus Exam Gold):
When reporting a privilege escalation path in the exam or a real engagement:

State the misconfiguration or vulnerability
e.g., “Sudo version 1.8.31 is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3156.”

Prove impact (root shell, file access, etc.)
Screenshot of id, whoami, or cat /etc/shadow

Explain fix or mitigation clearly

"Upgrade sudo to >= 1.9.5"

"Remove world-writable permission from /usr/lib/python3.8"

"Restrict access to cron job file at /etc/cron.d/backup"

Bonus points if you tie it to Linux hardening best practices like:

"Enforce least privilege in sudoers"

"Audit custom library permissions"

"Use tools like Lynis regularly"
