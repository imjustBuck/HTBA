ðŸ”¸ STANDARD FILE PERMISSIONS (User, Group, Others)
Every file/directory in Linux has three permission groups:

css
Copy
Edit
[User] [Group] [Other]
And each group has three possible permissions:

Symbol	Meaning	Numeric	Purpose
r	read	4	Can view contents
w	write	2	Can modify file or dir contents
x	execute	1	Can execute (or enter directory)
-	no permission	0	Nothing
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
-rwxr-xr--
rwx â†’ user has read/write/execute

r-x â†’ group has read/execute

r-- â†’ others have read-only

ðŸ”¸ SPECIAL PERMISSION BITS (Elevated Access)
Bit	Symbol	Numeric	Applies To	Purpose
setuid	s	4 (4000)	User	Run file as owner (often root) even if user is unprivileged
setgid	s	2 (2000)	Group	Run file as group; also affects group ownership on new files in dirs
sticky	t	1 (1000)	Others	Only file owner/root can delete files in a directory (e.g. /tmp)
ðŸ”¹ How They Look in ls -l:
Mode	Description
-rwsr-xr-x	setuid set on user (runs as file owner)
-rwxr-sr-x	setgid set on group (runs as group)
drwxrwxrwt	sticky bit set on dir (like /tmp)
ðŸ”¹ With no execute bit:
If x is missing but s/t is set:

Symbol	What it shows
S	setuid/setgid set, but no execute bit
T	sticky set, no execute bit
ðŸ”¸ NUMERIC MODE (Octal Values)
Each permission section is represented by a digit (0â€“7):

r	w	x	Value
âœ”	âœ”	âœ”	7
âœ”	âœ”	âœ˜	6
âœ”	âœ˜	âœ”	5
âœ”	âœ˜	âœ˜	4
âœ˜	âœ”	âœ”	3
âœ˜	âœ”	âœ˜	2
âœ˜	âœ˜	âœ”	1
âœ˜	âœ˜	âœ˜	0
Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod 755 file.sh
7 â†’ rwx (owner)

5 â†’ r-x (group)

5 â†’ r-x (others)

ðŸ”¸ SPECIAL BITS IN OCTAL FORMAT
Mode	Octal Prefix	Example
setuid	4xxx	chmod 4755 /bin/bash
setgid	2xxx	chmod 2755 /opt/script
sticky	1xxx	chmod 1777 /tmp
combo (e.g., setuid + setgid)	6xxx	chmod 6755 target
ðŸ”¸ DIRECTORY PERMISSION BEHAVIOR
Bit	Meaning in Directories
r	Can list files
w	Can add/remove files
x	Can enter directory
ðŸ”¸ Bonus: SUID/Special Lookup Shortcuts
Action	Command
Find all SUID binaries	find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
Find all SGID binaries	find / -perm -2000 -type f 2>/dev/null
Find all with Sticky	find / -type d -perm -1000 2>/dev/null
All special bits	find / -type f -perm /6000 2>/dev/null
ðŸ§  TL;DR Reference Chart
Symbol	What It Means
s	setuid/setgid (with x)
S	setuid/setgid (without x)
t	sticky bit (with x)
T	sticky bit (without x)
rwx	read/write/execute
---	no permissions
drwxrwxrwt	world-writable dir with sticky bit (/tmp)
