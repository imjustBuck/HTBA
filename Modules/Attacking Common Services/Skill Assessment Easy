We were commissioned by the company Inlanefreight to conduct a penetration test against three different hosts to check the servers' configuration and security. 
We were informed that a flag had been placed somewhere on each server to prove successful access. These flags have the following format:

HTB{...}
Our task is to review the security of each of the three servers and present it to the customer. According to our information, the first server is a server that manages emails, customers, and their files.
