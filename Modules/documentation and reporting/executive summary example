## ✍️ Template

### 1. Engagement Overview
> During the [assessment_type] conducted against [client_name], a total of **[X] findings** were identified. These findings were categorized as follows: **[Y High]**, **[Z Medium]**, **[A Low]**, and **[B Informational]**.

### 2. Key Findings
- Unauthenticated remote access via [vuln_name]
- Credential reuse across multiple systems
- Domain compromise via lateral movement from [X] to [Y]
- Lack of detection during enumeration, exploitation, and lateral movement

### 3. Impact Summary
> The tester was able to gain **Domain Admin** privileges via chained exploitation of [X], [Y], and [Z]. This demonstrates the ability for an attacker to compromise core systems and access sensitive data, including HR, finance, and backup environments.

### 4. Remediation Themes
- Harden internal authentication processes
- Segment and restrict excessive permissions
- Improve patch and configuration management
- Enhance detection visibility through SIEM tuning

### 5. Visibility Gaps
> No alerts or blocks were observed during critical phases of the test, suggesting that adversarial behavior may go undetected. This represents a significant risk of prolonged dwell time during a real-world attack.

### 6. Final Recommendations
> We recommend a phased remediation approach starting with [top 2-3], followed by medium-priority gaps, and culminating in long-term architectural and cultural changes (e.g., baseline hardening, password policies, and user training).
