🧠 CPTS Exam Summary: Components of a Report
🎯 Core Concept
The report is your final weapon. It's not just about showing off the cool hacks — it’s about translating them into value for the client. Think of it like this:

🔓 “The exploit got me in… but the report gets me paid (and rehired).”

📂 Report Structure Breakdown
Section	Importance	Description	Exam Focus
Executive Summary	💀 Critical	Non-technical, for leadership	Will definitely be graded. Master this.
Findings	💀 Critical	Technical, reproducible, impactful	Must follow a clear, actionable format
Attack Chain	✅ High	Highlights how you went from low to DA	Especially important in internal/AEN exams
Summary of Recommendations	✅ High	Maps findings to remediation roadmap	Show you can prioritize like a pro
Appendices (Static + Dynamic)	⚠️ Medium	Scope, methods, payloads, etc.	Only include if they bring value. Use sparingly.
Remediation Retest / Attestation Reports	⚠️ Medium	Seen in the real world, less likely to be on exam	Mention when relevant in long-form exams
Supporting Deliverables	Optional	Slides, spreadsheets, notifications	Know of them, don't need to produce unless asked
🔗 Attack Chain Write-Up (Exam Goldmine)
This section can double dip:

Re-usable screenshots

Streamlines findings

Shows understanding of chaining

Format to use:

✅ Step-by-step overview

🔍 Highlight vulnerabilities chained

📸 Evidence (screenshots, hashes, ticket data, etc.)

🧠 Insight: Describe why this chain matters (business impact)

💬 Tie to recommendation: e.g., "Breaking this link early would have mitigated..."

Example:

Responder → NTLM hash capture (bsmith)

Hash cracked → Foothold as low-priv user

Kerberoast → Crack SPN → Lateral to SQL01

LSA Secrets → Privilege escalation → TGT theft

Rubeus → PTT → DCSync via pramirez → Domain Admin

✅ CPTS Tip: Include short summaries + command evidence + screenshots.

✍️ Executive Summary Mastery
🎯 Goal:
Write to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., CISO, CIO, Board). You are selling risk in plain language.

🪄 Key Writing Rules:
No acronyms, no jargon

Keep under 2 pages

Tell them what was accessed, why it matters, and how to fix the root cause

Use phrases like:

“An attacker could gain access to...”

“This flaw allows...”

“Without detection, this could result in...”

🧠 Extra Points: Show empathy to the org: “We observed evidence of strong patch management processes...” — call out the good, it builds trust.

📌 Prioritization Strategy (Filtering Noise)
✅ Prioritize:

RCE

Credential access

Lateral movement paths

Weak authentication/authorization

❌ De-prioritize (group them):

SSL cipher stuff

Repetitive DoS vulns

Info-only unexploitable findings

🎯 On the Exam: You’ll be expected to explain why you didn’t blow 3 hours chasing a PoC that wouldn’t work. That’s the mark of experience.

📜 Appendices Cheat Sheet
🧱 Static (Always Include):
Scope

Methodology

Severity Ratings

Tester Biographies

🌀 Dynamic (Use If Necessary):
Payloads dropped

Credentials cracked

Config changes made

Additional affected scope

Password analysis (if dumped NTDS)

🎯 Tip: Don’t dump 80 pages of tool output. Use appendices strategically to show effort, not bloat.

🧵 Summary of Recommendations Section
Format:

Short-Term: Patch this, disable that

Medium-Term: Password policy revamp, file share audit

Long-Term: Review SDLC, deploy MFA org-wide

🧠 On the exam: You’ll likely need to recommend and justify remediation priorities. Don’t say “patch it.” Say:

“Patch MS-SQL to address Kerberoast. Longer term, review SPN assignments and enforce strong service account passwords with alerts on risky privileges.”

🏗️ Your Action Plan (for AEN practice + exam):
✅ Use this structure in every practice report

🧠 Create one reusable attack chain template you just paste into each report and customize

💬 Practice writing a 2-paragraph Executive Summary from each AEN run

📊 Create a “Findings Table” that shows:

Severity

Affected asset

Root cause

Risk

Remediation

🪖 Final Thought for the Exam
You’re not just a hacker — you’re the translator between chaos and clarity. Nail this section, and even if your shell access was weak, the examiner will respect your professionalism.

Absolutely, Buck — here are a few exam-worthy example answers to that exact question.

They’re designed to show:

✔️ Mature prioritization

✔️ Understanding of exploitation vs theory

✔️ Respect for time constraints

✔️ Clear, justifiable decision-making

💬 Example Answer 1: Weak PoC, No Impact
“I identified a potential Local File Inclusion vulnerability on the web server, but upon review, all PoC examples relied on deprecated PHP functions that were not present on the target system. Additionally, the vulnerability did not allow access outside the intended directory and lacked any output that could be leveraged for information disclosure or code execution. I documented the issue, marked it informational, and moved on to deeper authenticated testing paths that offered a more realistic path to internal compromise.”

💬 Example Answer 2: PoC Unreliable + Limited Scope
“The vulnerability scan flagged a known issue in Apache Struts. While there was public PoC code available, it targeted a different version and configuration. I reviewed the source and confirmed the affected module wasn’t even installed on the server. Rather than waste time troubleshooting an irrelevant PoC, I focused efforts on exposed SMB services with no signing, which led to credential theft and lateral movement.”

💬 Example Answer 3: Risk vs Reward Tradeoff
“I attempted to verify a reported SQL injection vulnerability, but it appeared to be blind and required time-consuming error-based enumeration. Given time constraints and the fact that the service was internal-only, I deprioritized exploitation and pivoted to Kerberoasting and credential reuse paths, which had a significantly higher return on investment and directly contributed to domain compromise.”

💬 Example Answer 4: Tool Error — Validated Risk, Not Chased
“During automated scanning, the tool flagged multiple outdated Java versions across endpoints. However, most of these were JREs not tied to externally exposed applications and didn’t present a direct risk based on enumeration. Rather than spend time proving arbitrary code execution through deprecated APIs, I documented the finding and focused efforts on reachable RDP endpoints where password spraying yielded multiple valid domain creds.”

💬 Example Answer 5: Senior Consultant Mindset
“I initially considered pursuing a complex deserialization attack on an old Tomcat host, but after analyzing the workflow and dependencies, I concluded exploitation would require too many ideal conditions to be practical. Instead, I opted to leverage default credentials on the same host, which gave me system-level access within minutes. My goal was to maximize domain coverage, not chase edge-case exploits.”

These examples:

Show you made a call based on risk and reward

Demonstrate efficiency under time pressure

Emphasize practical exploitation, not academic guessing
