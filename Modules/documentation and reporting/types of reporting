🔑 Core Takeaway for CPTS + Exam
For your AEN practice runs and CPTS exam, the most critical report to replicate and master is the Internal Penetration Test Report structure — with:

✅ Executive Summary

✅ Attack Path narrative

✅ Technical Findings (with evidence)

✅ Screenshots + Logs

✅ Remediation Steps

🧩 Report Types – Summary & Importance
1. ✅ Internal Penetration Test Report (⭐️ Most important for CPTS)
Use when: Compromising AD or hosts in an internal environment.

CPTS focus: This is the format you’ll mimic in the exam and during your AEN runs.

Sections:

Executive Summary

Scope & Methodology

Attack Chain Narrative (from foothold to DA)

Individual Findings

Evidence (logs/screenshots)

Remediation

Obsidian-ready template? ✔️ Yup, you've already built the structure for this.

2. ✅ Vulnerability Assessment Report
Use when: You just run scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS, etc.) with or without creds.

Focus: Themes, counts, severity levels, procedural gaps.

Important for: Clients that want non-exploitative findings. Common in compliance work.

CPTS relevance: Low — but good to know for narrative filler if your AEN run has limited exploit chains.

3. ✅ Draft Report
Use when: Submitting to client for initial review/feedback.

Contents: Full report, but client may tweak language, findings severity, or add responses.

Important because:

It shows professionalism and process.

You avoid surprise changes last minute.

4. ✅ Final Report
Use when: Client signs off on the draft.

Deliverable: Locked-in, polished copy (often PDF or signed doc).

CPTS relevance: You’re simulating this when submitting your report post-AEN or exam.

5. 🔁 Post-Remediation Report
Use when: Client wants you to re-check only previously reported findings.

Focus:

Don’t scan the entire network again.

Retest just what was originally found.

Good practice: Time-limit retests (e.g., must be done within 45 days).

CPTS relevance: Optional, but this teaches disciplined scope control and reporting hygiene.

6. 📄 Attestation Report
Use when: Client needs to prove to third parties they’ve been tested.

Contents: Only high-level info — no creds, IPs, or attack details.

Usually: 1–2 pages.

CPTS relevance: N/A to exam, but great real-world add-on.

7. 🖥️ Slide Deck
Use when: Presenting to stakeholders — technical or exec.

Focus: Storytelling, relevance to business risk.

Tips:

No death by PowerPoint.

Add personal anecdotes.

Tie risk to industry-specific news/events.

CPTS relevance: Helps build soft skills if you plan to run your MSSP or lead client calls.

8. 📊 Spreadsheet of Findings
Use when: Client needs sortable, importable report data.

Includes: Severity, CVEs, system names, remediation notes.

Tip: Pivot tables = 🔥 for prioritization.

CPTS relevance: Not part of exam but a nice bonus to include in real-world reports.

9. ⚠️ Vulnerability Notification (During Assessment)
Use when: You find something critical mid-assessment that could expose data.

Includes: Only raw tech detail. No fluff. Meant for fast triage and fix.

When to send: If you find:

Remote unauthenticated RCE

Default creds on public apps

Sensitive data exposures

CPTS relevance: Not part of the exam, but if you find something urgent in a real AEN, this is the correct way to handle it.

📦 Report Types for Specialized Assessments (Know the Differences)
💠 Purple Team Engagement
Combined Red + Blue

Red team simulates attack, blue team tunes detections.

Important to document actions/timeline for correlation.

☁️ Cloud Focused Testing
May include AWS/Azure/GCP roles, IAM misconfigs, secret leakage.

Benefits from dev/ops knowledge.

Format = PenTest report with cloud-specific findings.

📲 IoT / Hardware Testing
Includes firmware, JTAG, physical tamper testing.

Unique tooling and skillsets required.

Follows standard report layout, but with niche evidence.

🌐 Web App PenTest
Can be:

App-only testing (no infra)

Full-chain (app ➝ shell ➝ pivot ➝ AD)

Often includes authenticated and role-based testing.

Report format still mostly the same: Findings ➝ PoC ➝ Remediation.

💥 TL;DR: What’s Most Important for the CPTS Exam?
✅ You MUST master:

Internal Penetration Test Report

Attack Chains

Technical Finding write-ups

Screenshots with proper redaction and formatting

Timelines, scope adherence, and logging

Optional but good habits:

Logging tools used

Payloads dropped (and where)

Scripting/automation logs

Cleanup notes
