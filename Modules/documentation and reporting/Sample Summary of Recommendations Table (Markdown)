Great question, Buck ‚Äî in the context of the Summary of Recommendations table, the term refers to how long it will likely take to implement the fix, not how fast it could be exploited.

üîç Breakdown:
Short Term ‚Üí
Quick wins.
Easy config change, patch, or password update. Usually fixable in days to a week.

Medium Term ‚Üí
Requires some planning or testing.
Maybe a GPO rollout, privilege cleanup, or tighter share permissions. Fixable in 1‚Äì3 weeks.

Long Term ‚Üí
Strategic changes or architectural shifts.
Things like:

Building a secure baseline/hardening template

Deploying LAPS org-wide

SDLC integrations for secure coding
These take months or need leadership buy-in.

üß† Why this matters in reporting (esp. on CPTS exam):
You're not just dumping findings ‚Äî you're helping the client build a roadmap. It shows maturity, empathy for business ops, and solid consulting skills (aka: extra exam points).

If you ever get stuck on this during the exam, just ask yourself:

"If I were the client's IT lead reading this, would I know what to fix first and how soon I could realistically get it done?"
