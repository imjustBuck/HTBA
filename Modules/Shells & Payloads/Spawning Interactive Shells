At the end of the last section, we established a shell session with the target. Initially, our shell was limited (sometimes referred to as a jail shell), so we used python to spawn a TTY bourne shell to give us access to more commands and a prompt to work from. This will likely be a situation we find ourselves in more and more as we practice on Hack The Box and in the real world on engagements.

There may be times that we land on a system with a limited shell, and Python is not installed. In these cases, it's good to know that we could use several different methods to spawn an interactive shell. Let's examine some of them.

Know that whenever we see /bin/sh or /bin/bash, this could also be replaced with the binary associated with the shell interpreter language present on that system. With most Linux systems, we will likely come across bourne shell (/bin/sh) and bourne again shell (/bin/bash) present on the system natively.

/bin/sh -i
This command will execute the shell interpreter specified in the path in interactive mode (-i).

Interactive
SYNTAX: 
/bin/sh -i
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-4.2$
Perl
If the programming language Perl is present on the system, these commands will execute the shell interpreter specified.

Perl To Shell
SYNTAX: 
perl —e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
perl: exec "/bin/sh";

The command directly above should be run from a script.

Ruby
If the programming language Ruby is present on the system, this command will execute the shell interpreter specified:

Ruby To Shell
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
The command directly above should be run from a script.

Lua
If the programming language Lua is present on the system, we can use the os.execute method to execute the shell interpreter specified using the full command below:

Lua To Shell
SYNTAX: 
lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
The command directly above should be run from a script.

AWK
AWK is a C-like pattern scanning and processing language present on most UNIX/Linux-based systems, widely used by developers and sysadmins to generate reports. It can also be used to spawn an interactive shell. This is shown in the short awk script below:

AWK To Shell
SYNTAX: 
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
Find
Find is a command present on most Unix/Linux systems widely used to search for & through files and directories using various criteria. It can also be used to execute applications and invoke a shell interpreter.

Using Find For A Shell
SYNTAX: 
find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
This use of the find command is searching for any file listed after the -name option, then it executes awk (/bin/awk) and runs the same script we discussed in the awk section to execute a shell interpreter.

Using Exec To Launch A Shell
SYNTAX:
find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
This use of the find command uses the execute option (-exec) to initiate the shell interpreter directly. If find can't find the specified file, then no shell will be attained.

VIM
Yes, we can set the shell interpreter language from within the popular command-line-based text-editor VIM. This is a very niche situation we would find ourselves in to need to use this method, but it is good to know just in case.

Vim To Shell
SYNTAX: 
vim -c ':!/bin/sh'

Vim Escape
SYNTAX: 
vim
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
Execution Permissions Considerations
In addition to knowing about all the options listed above, we should be mindful of the permissions we have with the shell session's account. We can always attempt to run this command to list the file properties and permissions our account has over any given file or binary:

Permissions
SYNTAX: 
ls -la <path/to/fileorbinary>
We can also attempt to run this command to check what sudo permissions the account we landed on has:

Sudo -l
SYNTAX: 
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for apache on ILF-WebSrv:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User apache may run the following commands on ILF-WebSrv:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
The sudo -l command above will need a stable interactive shell to run. If you are not in a full shell or sitting in an unstable shell, you may not get any return from it. Not only will considering permissions allow us to see what commands we can execute, but it may also start to give us an idea of potential vectors that will allow us to escalate privileges.
