Prominent Windows Exploits
Over the last few years, several vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and their corresponding attacks are some of the most exploited vulnerabilities of our time. Let's discuss those for a minute:

Vulnerability	Description
MS08-067	MS08-067 was a critical patch pushed out to many different Windows revisions due to an SMB flaw. This flaw made it extremely easy to infiltrate a Windows host. It was so efficient that the Conficker worm was using it to infect every vulnerable host it came across. Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability.
Eternal Blue	MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host.
PrintNightmare	A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome post on it here.
BlueKeep	CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2.
Sigred	CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server which is commonly the primary Domain Controller.
SeriousSam	CVE 2021-36934 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the C:\Windows\system32\config folder. Before fixing the issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials.
Zerologon	CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via the protocol. The attack can be a bit complex, but it is trivial to execute since an attacker would have to make around 256 guesses at a computer account password before finding what they need. This can happen in a matter of a few seconds.
With these vulnerabilities in mind, Windows isn't going anywhere. We need to be proficient with identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and moving around in Windows hosts and environments. An understanding of these concepts can help us secure our environments from attack as well. Now it's time to dive in and explore some Windows-focused exploit fun.

Enumerating Windows & Fingerprinting Methods
This module assumes you have already performed your host enumeration phase and understand what services are commonly seen on hosts. We are just attempting to give you a few quick tricks to determine if a host is likely a Windows machine. Check out the Network Enumeration With NMAP module for a more detailed look at host enumeration and fingerprinting.

Since we have a set of targets, what are a few ways to determine if the host is likely a Windows Machine? To answer this question, we can look at a few things. The first one being the Time To Live (TTL) counter when utilizing ICMP to determine if the host is up. A typical response from a Windows host will either be 32 or 128. A response of or around 128 is the most common response you will see. This value may not always be exact, especially if you are not in the same layer three network as the target. We can utilize this value since most hosts will never be more than 20 hops away from your point of origin, so there is little chance of the TTL counter dropping into the acceptable values of another OS type. In the ping output below, we can see an example of this. For the example, we pinged a Windows 10 host and can see we have received replies with a TTL of 128. Check out this link for a nice table showing other TTL values by OS.

Nmap has a cool capability built in to help with OS identification and many other scripted scans to check for anything from a specific vulnerability to information gathered from SNMP. For this example, we will utilize the -O option with verbose output -v to initialize an OS Identification scan against our target 192.168.86.39. As we scroll through the shell session below and look at the results, a few things give this away as a Windows host. We will focus on those here in a minute. Look carefully at the bottom of the shell session. We can see the point labeled OS CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_10 and OS details: Microsoft Windows 10 1709 - 1909. Nmap made this guess based on several different metrics it derives from the TCP/IP stack. It uses those qualities to determine the OS as it checks it against a database of OS fingerprints. In this case, Nmap has determined that our host is a Windows 10 machine with a revision level between 1709 & 1909.

If you run into issues and the scans turn up little results, attempt again with the -A and -Pn options. This will perform a different scan and may work. For more info on how this process works, check out this article from the Nmap Documentation. Be careful of this detection method. Implementing a firewall or other security features can obscure the host or mess the results up. When possible, use more than one check to make a determination.

Now that we know we are dealing with a Windows 10 host, we need to enumerate the services we can see to determine if we have a potential avenue of exploitation. To perform banner grabbing, we can use several different tools. Netcat, Nmap, and many others can perform the enumeration we need, but for this instance, we will look at a simple Nmap script called banner.nse. For each port Nmap sees as up, it will attempt to connect to the port and glean any information it can from it. In the session below, Nmap tried to connect to each port, but the only ports to give back a response were ports 902 and 912. Based on the page banner, they have something to do with VMWare Workstation. We can attempt to find an exploit dealing with that protocol, or we can further enumerate the other ports. In a real pentest, you will want to be as thorough as possible, making sure you have the full lay of the land.

The examples shown above are just a few ways to help fingerprint and determine if a host is a Windows machine. It is by no means an exhaustive list, and there are many other checks you can do. Now that we have discussed fingerprinting let's look at several file types and what they can be used for when building out payloads.

Payload Transfer and Execution:
Besides the vectors of web-drive-by, phishing emails, or dead drops, Windows hosts can provide us with several other avenues of payload delivery. The list below includes some helpful tools and protocols for use while attempting to drop a payload on a target.

*!*!*! Impacket: Impacket is a toolset built-in Python that provides us a way to interact with network protocols directly. Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with psexec, smbclient, wmi, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server.

*!*!*!* Payloads All The Things: is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently.

*!*!*!SMB: SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. We, as attackers, can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links.

*!*!*!*! Remote execution via MSF: Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically.

*!*!*!* Other Protocols: When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use.
Now that we know what tools, tactics, and procedures we can use to transfer our payloads, let's check out an example compromise process.



Example Compromise Walkthrough
Enumerate The Host
Ping, Netcat, Nmap scans, and even Metasploit are all good options to start enumerating our potential victims. To start this time, we will utilize an Nmap scan. The enumeration portion of any exploit chain is arguably the most critical piece of the puzzle. Understanding the target and what makes it tick will raise your chances of gaining a shell.

We figured out a few things during scanning & validation of the example host in question. It is running Windows Server 2016 Standard 6.3. We have the hostname now, and we know it is not in a domain and is running several services. Now that we have gathered some information let's determine our potential exploit path.
IIS could be a potential path, attempting to access the host over SMB utilizing a tool like Impacket or authenticating if we had credentials could do it, and from an OS perspective, there may be a route for an RCE as well. MS17-010 (EternalBlue) has been known to affect hosts ranging from Windows 2008 to Server 2016. With this in mind, it could be a solid bet that our victim is vulnerable since it falls in that window. Let's validate that using a builtin auxiliary check from Metasploit, auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010.

Search for and decide on an exploit path
Open msfconsole and search for EternalBlue, or you can use the string in the session below to use the check. Set the RHOSTS field with the target's IP address and initiate the scan. As can be seen in the options for the module, you can fill in more of the SMB settings, but it is not necessary. They will help to make the check more likely to succeed. When ready, type run.

This time, we kept it simple and just used a windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload. You can change this as you wish for a different shell type or obfuscate your attack more, as shown in the previous payloads sections. With our options set, let's give this a try and see if we land a shell.

Success! We have landed our exploit and gained a shell session. A SYSTEM level shell at that. As seen in the earlier MSF modules, now that we have an open session through Meterpreter, we are presented with the meterpreter > prompt. From here, we can utilize Meterpreter to run further commands to gather system information, steal user credentials, or use another post-exploitation module against the host. If you wish to interact with the host directly, you can also drop into an interactive shell session on the host from Meterpreter.

Identify the Native Shell.

When we executed the Meterpreter command shell, it started another process on the host and dropped us into a system shell. Can you determine what we are in from the prompt? Just seeing C:\Windows\system32> can clue us in that we are just in a cmd.exe shell. To make sure, simply running the command help from within the shell will also let you know. If we were dropped into PowerShell, our prompt would look like PS C:\Windows\system32>. The PS in front lets us know it is a PowerShell session. Congrats on dropping into a shell on our latest exploited Windows host.

Now that we have run through a sample compromise process let's examine the shells you can see when you land on the host.
