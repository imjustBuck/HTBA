Privileges are different from access rights, which a system uses to grant or deny access to securable objects. User and group privileges are stored in a database and granted via an access token when a user logs on to a system. 

***!!!An account can have local privileges on a specific computer and different privileges on different systems if the account belongs to an Active Directory domain.***!!!

Most privileges are disabled by default. Some can be enabled by opening an administrative cmd.exe or PowerShell console, while others can be enabled manually.

The goal of an assessment is often to gain administrative access to a system or multiple systems. Suppose we can log in to a system as a user with a specific set of privileges. In that case, we may be able to leverage this built-in functionality to escalate privileges directly or use the target account's assigned privileges to further our access in pursuit of our ultimate goal.
