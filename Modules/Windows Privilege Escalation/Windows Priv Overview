Privileges are different from access rights, which a system uses to grant or deny access to securable objects. User and group privileges are stored in a database and granted via an access token when a user logs on to a system. 

***!!!An account can have local privileges on a specific computer and different privileges on different systems if the account belongs to an Active Directory domain.***!!!

Most privileges are disabled by default. Some can be enabled by opening an administrative cmd.exe or PowerShell console, while others can be enabled manually.

The goal of an assessment is often to gain administrative access to a system or multiple systems. Suppose we can log in to a system as a user with a specific set of privileges. In that case, we may be able to leverage this built-in functionality to escalate privileges directly or use the target account's assigned privileges to further our access in pursuit of our ultimate goal.

WINDOWS AUTH PROCESS: 

 Security principals are the primary way of controlling access to resources on Windows hosts. Every single security principal is identified by a unique Security Identifier (SID). When a security principal is created, it is assigned a SID which remains assigned to that principal for its lifetime.

Rights and Privileges in Windows
Windows contains many groups that grant their members powerful rights and privileges. Many of these can be abused to escalate privileges on both a standalone Windows host and within an Active Directory domain environment. Ultimately, these may be used to gain Domain Admin, local administrator, or SYSTEM privileges on a Windows workstation, server, or Domain Controller (DC). Some of these groups are listed below.

Group	                                                                                          Description
* Default Administrators	                                                                  Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins are "super" groups.
* Server Operators	                                                                        Members can modify services, access SMB shares, and backup files.
* Backup Operators	                                                                        Members are allowed to log onto DCs locally and should be considered Domain Admins. They can make shadow copies of the SAM/NTDS database, read the registry remotely, and access the file system on the DC via SMB. This group is sometimes added to the local Backup Operators group on non-DCs.
* Print Operators	                                                                         Members can log on to DCs locally and "trick" Windows into loading a malicious driver.
* Hyper-V Administrators	                                                                  If there are virtual DCs, any virtualization admins, such as members of Hyper-V Administrators, should be considered Domain Admins.
* Account Operators	                                                                       Members can modify non-protected accounts and groups in the domain.
* Remote Desktop Users	                                                                    Members are not given any useful permissions by default but are often granted additional rights such as Allow Login Through Remote Desktop Services and can move laterally using the RDP protocol.
* Remote Management Users	                                                                 Members can log on to DCs with PSRemoting (This group is sometimes added to the local remote management group on non-DCs).
* Group Policy Creator Owners	                                                             Members can create new GPOs but would need to be delegated additional permissions to link GPOs to a container such as a domain or OU.
* Schema Admins	                                                                           Members can modify the Active Directory schema structure and backdoor any to-be-created Group/GPO by adding a compromised account to the default object ACL.
* DNS Admins	                                                                              Members can load a DLL on a DC, but do not have the necessary permissions to restart the DNS server. They can load a malicious DLL and wait for a reboot as a persistence mechanism. Loading a DLL will often result in the service crashing. A more reliable way to exploit this group is to create a WPAD record.
