During an assessment, we may gain a low-privileged shell on a Windows host (domain-joined or not) and need to perform privilege escalation to further our access. Fully compromising the host may gain us access to sensitive files/file shares, grant us the ability to capture traffic to obtain more credentials, or obtain credentials that can help further our access or even escalate directly to Domain Admin in an Active Directory environment. We can escalate privileges to one of the following depending on the system configuration and what type of data we encounter:


The highly privileged NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, or LocalSystem account which is a highly privileged account with more privileges than a local administrator account and is used to run most Windows services.
The built-in local administrator account. Some organizations disable this account, but many do not. It is not uncommon to see this account reused across multiple systems in a client environment.
Another local account that is a member of the local Administrators group. Any account in this group will have the same privileges as the built-in administrator account.
A standard (non-privileged) domain user who is part of the local Administrators group.
A domain admin (highly privileged in the Active Directory environment) that is part of the local Administrators group.

Enumeration is the key to privilege escalation. When we gain initial shell access to the host, it is vital to gain situational awareness and uncover details relating to the OS version, patch level, installed software, current privileges, group memberships, and more. 

Key Data Points
OS name: Knowing the type of Windows OS (workstation or server) and level (Windows 7 or 10, Server 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019, etc.) will give us an idea of the types of tools that may be available (such as the PowerShell version), or lack thereof on legacy systems. This would also identify the operating system version for which there may be public exploits available.

Version: As with the OS version, there may be public exploits that target a vulnerability in a specific version of Windows. Windows system exploits can cause system instability or even a complete crash. Be careful running these against any production system, and make sure you fully understand the exploit and possible ramifications before running one.

Running Services: Knowing what services are running on the host is important, especially those running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or an administrator-level account. A misconfigured or vulnerable service running in the context of a privileged account can be an easy win for privilege escalation.

Let's take a more in-depth look.

System Information
Looking at the system itself will give us a better idea of the exact operating system version, hardware in use, installed programs, and security updates. This will help us narrow down our hunt for any missing patches and associated CVEs that we may be able to leverage to escalate privileges. Using the tasklist command to look at running processes will give us a better idea of what applications are currently running on the system.

It is essential to become familiar with standard Windows processes such as Session Manager Subsystem (smss.exe), Client Server Runtime Subsystem (csrss.exe), WinLogon (winlogon.exe), Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), and Service Host (svchost.exe), among others and the services associated with them.Being able to spot standard processes/services quickly will help speed up our enumeration and enable us to hone in on non-standard processes/services, which may open up a privilege escalation path. In the example above, we would be most interested in the FileZilla FTP server running and would attempt to enumerate the version to look for public vulnerabilities or misconfigurations such as FTP anonymous access, which could lead to sensitive data exposure or more.


Display All Environment Variables
The environment variables explain a lot about the host configuration. To get a printout of them, Windows provides the set command. One of the most overlooked variables is PATH. In the output below, nothing is out of the ordinary. However, it is not uncommon to find administrators (or applications) modify the PATH. One common example is to place Python or Java in the path, which would allow the execution of Python or . JAR files. If the folder placed in the PATH is writable by your user, it may be possible to perform DLL Injections against other applications. Remember, when running a program, Windows looks for that program in the CWD (Current Working Directory) first, then from the PATH going left to right. This means if the custom path is placed on the left (before C:\Windows\System32), it is much more dangerous than on the right.

In addition to the PATH, set can also give up other helpful information such as the HOME DRIVE. In enterprises, this will often be a file share. Navigating to the file share itself may reveal other directories that can be accessed. It is not unheard of to be able to access an "IT Directory," which contains an inventory spreadsheet that includes passwords. Additionally, shares are utilized for home directories so the user can log on to other computers and have the same experience/files/desktop/etc. (Roaming Profiles). This may also mean the user takes malicious items with them. If a file is placed in USERPROFILE\AppData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup, when the user logs into a different machine, this file will execute.

View Detailed Configuration Information
The systeminfo command will show if the box has been patched recently and if it is a VM. If the box has not been patched recently, getting administrator-level access may be as simple as running a known exploit. The System Boot Time and OS Version can also be checked to get an idea of the patch level. If the box has not been restarted in over six months, chances are it is also not being patched. Additionally, many guides will say the Network Information is important as it could indicate a dual-homed machine (connected to multiple networks). Generally speaking, when it comes to enterprises, devices will just be granted access to other networks via a firewall rule and not have a physical cable run to them.

User & Group Information : Users are often the weakest link in an organization, especially when systems are configured and patched well. It is essential to gain an understanding of the users and groups on the system, members of specific groups that can provide us with admin level access, the privileges our current user has, password policy information, and any logged on users that we may be able to target. 

Logged in users: It is always important to determine what users are logged into a system. Are they idle or active? Can we determine what they are working on? While more challenging to pull off, we can sometimes attack users directly to escalate privileges or gain further access. During an evasive engagement, we would need to tread lightly on a host with other user(s) actively working on it to avoid detection.

CMD Syntax: C:\htb> query user

Current User: When we gain access to a host, we should always check what user context our account is running under first. Sometimes, we are already SYSTEM or equivalent! Suppose we gain access as a service account. In that case, we may have privileges such as SeImpersonatePrivilege, which can often be easily abused to escalate privileges using a tool such as Juicy Potato.
