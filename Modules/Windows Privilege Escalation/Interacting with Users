Users are *usually* the weakest link in an organization. An overloaded employee working quickly may not notice something is "off" on their machine when browsing a shared drive, clicking on a link, or running a file. As discussed throughout this module, Windows presents us with an enormous attack surface, and there are many things to check for when enumerating local privilege escalation vectors. Once we have exhausted all options, we can look at specific techniques to steal credentials from an unsuspecting user by sniffing their network traffic/local commands or attacking a known vulnerable service requiring user interaction. One of my favorite techniques is placing malicious files around heavily accessed file shares in an attempt to retrieve user password hashes to crack offline later.

Can use TCPDUMP or wireshark to catch and look through traffic - !*!*!* THIS TOOK net-creds (https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds) can run and sniff passwords and hashes from packet captures, its a good idea to let it run during an assessment.
