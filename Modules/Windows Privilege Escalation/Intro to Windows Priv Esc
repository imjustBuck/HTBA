After gaining a foothold, elevating our privileges will provide more options for persistence and may reveal information stored locally that can further our access within the environment. The general goal of Windows privilege escalation is to further our access to a given system to a member of the Local Administrators group or the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM LocalSystem account. There may, however, be scenarios where escalating to another user on the system may be enough to reach our goal. Privilege escalation is typically a vital step during any engagement. We need to use the access obtained, or some data (such as credentials) found only once we have a session in an elevated context. In some cases, privilege escalation may be the ultimate goal of the assessment if our client hires us for a "gold image" or "workstation breakout" type assessment. Privilege escalation is often vital to continue through a network towards our ultimate objective, as well as for lateral movement.


That being said, we may need to escalate privileges for one of the following reasons:

1.	When testing a client's gold image Windows workstation and server build for flaws
2.	To escalate privileges locally to gain access to some local resource such as a database
3.	To gain NT AUTHORITY\System level access on a domain-joined machine to gain a foothold into the client's Active Directory environment
4.	To obtain credentials to move laterally or escalate privileges within the client's network


Windows systems present a vast attack surface. Just some of the ways that we can escalate privileges are:

Abusing Windows group privileges	Abusing Windows user privileges
Bypassing User Account Control	Abusing weak service/file permissions
Leveraging unpatched kernel exploits	Credential theft
Traffic Capture	and more.
