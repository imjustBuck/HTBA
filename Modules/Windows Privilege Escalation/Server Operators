The Server Operators group allows members to administer Windows servers without needing assignment of Domain Admin privileges. It is a very highly privileged group that can log in locally to servers, including Domain Controllers.

Membership of this group confers the powerful SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege privileges and the ability to control local services.
