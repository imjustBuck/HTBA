Windows Privilege Escalation Skills Assessment - Part I
During a penetration test against the INLANEFREIGHT organization, you encounter a non-domain joined Windows server host that suffers from an unpatched command injection vulnerability. After gaining a foothold, you come across credentials that may be useful for lateral movement later in the assessment and uncover another flaw that can be leveraged to escalate privileges on the target host.

For this assessment, assume that your client has a relatively mature patch/vulnerability management program but is understaffed and unaware of many of the best practices around configuration management, which could leave a host open to privilege escalation.

Enumerate the host (starting with an Nmap port scan to identify accessible ports/services), leverage the command injection flaw to gain reverse shell access, escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM level or similar access, and answer the questions below to complete this portion of the assessment.



Question 1 - Which two KBs are installed on the target system? (Answer format: 3210000&3210060)



Question 2 - Find the password for the ldapadmin account somewhere on the system.



Question 3 - Escalate privileges and submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop.



Question 4 - After escalating privileges, locate a file named confidential.txt. Submit the contents of this file.
