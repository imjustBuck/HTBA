🧠 TL;DR:
You're dangerously close to being CPTS-ready — and miles beyond most on paper. But “close” ain’t the goal. You want flawless execution under pressure, and there are still a few cracks that need sealing if you want to dominate and not just pass.

🔍 Brutal Breakdown – Where You’re At Right Now
✅ Your Strengths (Don’t skip this — these are foundation)
Full Kill Chain Execution
You showed clean progression:

Initial foothold → internal pivot → AD compromise → full root.

Rare for someone to nail both the Windows + Linux paths without hand-holding.

You’re not just copy/pasting—you understand what the tools are doing.

Sharp Instincts Mid-Engagement

You know when to switch tools, troubleshoot PowerView errors, fall back to proxychains, reset modules, etc.

You documented real pivot chains without fluff — that’s analyst/report-grade material.

You Think Like a Red Teamer

You’re not just solving for flags — you're simulating realistic client impact.

You think about DLP, domain trust abuse, lateral movement chains.

That mindset is rarer than you think. It sets you apart — MSSP material already.

Command Fluency

No hesitation using evil-winrm, impacket, ssh port forwards, hashcat, BloodHound, Metasploit, manual SUID checks — that’s real-world-ready shit.

🩻 Where You’re Weak (and NEED to tighten the screws)
1. Tool Paranoia / Delay
❌ You still hesitate to run SharpHound right after initial access.
✅ Fix: Make it muscle memory. You don’t need to waste 20–30 mins manually digging for access control paths when the damn thing is built to show you.
→ Practice Speed-Deploying SharpHound:

SharpHound.ps1 PowerShell

SharpHound.exe binary

Snaffler fallback

SSH transfer → RDP in → trigger → exfil .zip

🎯 Daily Drill:
Drop SharpHound from 3 different access points (RDP, evil-winrm, reverse shell) and parse it in BloodHound in <5 mins.

2. "Halfway Automation" Fatigue
❌ You’re doing way too much manually (e.g., port sweeps, kerberoasting setups, DC shell builds). ✅ Efficiency = stamina for the 24h exam.

→ Build Your Own Toolbelt Wrapper
Create personal bash scripts, e.g.:

kerbroast_auto.sh → handles SPN set + GetUserSPNs + hashcat

proxy_enum.sh → automates proxychains + nmap/ffuf/wget

init_winrm_enum.ps1 → imports PowerView, lists local admins, SIDs, domain trusts

3. Credential Hunting vs. Weaponizing
❌ You’re finding creds (good), but not always testing all permutations or contexts. ✅ In an exam, every password cracked should be thrown at:

RDP

SMB (CrackMapExec)

WinRM

MSSQL logins

Local admin attempts

Reuse across pivoted boxes

🎯 Daily Drill:
Run a full brute-force reuse routine with 3 known creds across multiple pivoted hosts/services.

4. Obsidian Is Heavy, but Not Agile Yet
❌ Your notes are extensive, but they need faster searchability and “low-brain” recall.

→ Build a “Red Team Quick Ref.md”

Flowchart logic like:
Got GenericAll on Group? → Add self → DCSync → DA Got weak kernel? → uname → CVE? → local exploit

Markdown with links to local tools/scripts per step

🎯 Goal: Every attack path in AEN should be in Obsidian in under 3 steps of logic.

🧭 What To Do for the Next 14 Days
📆 WEEK 1: Sharpen, Streamline, Drill
✅ 1 Full Re-Run of AEN with strict 2x time pressure (aim for completion in <12 hours)

✅ Speed deploy SharpHound 5x from different footholds

✅ Build and test a custom mini toolbelt

One-line scripts for: proxychains+Nmap, SPN abuse, hashcat+autocrack, etc.

✅ Practice double pivot w/ socks proxy → SSH (build a mini lab if needed)

📆 WEEK 2: Burn It In
✅ Flash Card Workflow Drills

“Got SPN, Now What?”

“Dumped creds, Now What?”

“Found 2nd subnet, How to pivot?”

If you can’t answer in 15 seconds, fix it.

✅ One more blind run — completely note-free

If you can beat it without looking at Obsidian, you're exam-day ready.

✅ Build a Cheat Sheet Bundle for Exam Day

Reverse shell syntax

Proxychains setups

Hashcat modes

PowerView command hits

BloodHound ACE-to-action cheat sheet

Exploit fallback plans (DirtyPipe, PrintSpoofer, etc.)

🧨 Harsh Truths
⚠️ You’re not done — you’re dangerous, but unpolished.

💯 You’d pass CPTS right now on knowledge — but might struggle on time if you don’t get faster.

🧠 You're still relying on memory for things that should be muscle memory (e.g., DCSync flow, socks proxy chaining).

🏆 The difference between “pass” and “holy shit Buck crushed this” is automation + mental agility under fatigue.

Final Verdict:
✅ CPTS-Ready in 14 Days — if you sharpen these weak spots.
❌ Not quite "client-grade red teamer who can scale ops on the fly" yet.
But you’re not far — and you’re playing in that league now.

So let’s lock in, Buck. 14 days, no fluff, no wasted reps. Let’s turn you into a walking kill chain.

You want a daily warm-up plan, or a checklist tracker next?
