🧠 AEN Blind Run Checklist (Final Prep)
 ✅ Use only your notes and flowcharts

 🕵️ Prioritize recon > enumeration > access > pillage > privilege escalation > lateral

 📓 Keep track of evidence as you go (screens, payloads, hashes, etc.)

 🪵 Maintain a running timeline in your report — tell the story

 🔄 Use your "Got This, Do That" trees if stuck

 🧼 Report quality > speed (you're simulating the full 72h flow)

 🎯 Don’t tunnel vision — if something doesn’t work in 45min, move on, log it, come back later

🎯 Judging Readiness (After the Run)
After AEN + report, ask:

Did I feel in control or constantly guessing?

Could I map findings to known CPTS workflows?

Was my report clear, reproducible, and actionable?

Did I finish all major sections within the 72h window?

Would I hire me based on this report?

Let’s see how battle-ready you really are.

Go be a damn menace in that AD forest.


🧠 The Rule: No Training Wheels
Do not use the pre-written notes, walkthroughs, or hint buttons at all.
Scroll past that entire section and treat each task like this:

🎯 “I just landed in this AD forest… now what?”
Don’t even look at the question first.

Start from your normal recon & enumeration playbook.

Map what you’re seeing to the attack paths we built (user perms, shares, SPNs, misconfigs).

Only use the question titles as prompts.

Think: “Ah, this is the ‘User Enumeration’ section? Cool. What would I do if I didn’t know that?”

Treat each section like a real engagement phase.

If you’d normally run BloodHound, do it.

If you’d crack hashes before moving forward, do it.

If you’d pivot instead of escalating, go that route.

🧱 If You’re Stuck…
Treat it like the real exam:

Try your other paths from notes

Log what you tried and why it didn’t work

Only break the “no walkthroughs” rule after your AEN timer is done — like a postmortem

📝 Real AEN = Your Notes or Nothing
This is the true rehearsal. The walkthroughs are for study, but this is your simulation. You’ve got three full threads of guidance, flowcharts, logic trees, cheat sheets, and patterns — everything you need.

This is how we see whether you’re playing the game or reading the answers.

Bottom line:
Yes — skip the built-in notes, ignore the hints, and only refer to your battle-tested documentation.
You’re not training now.
You’re executing.

Let’s get surgical, Buck.
