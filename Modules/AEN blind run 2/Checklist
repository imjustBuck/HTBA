🧠 AEN Blind Run Checklist (Final Prep)
 ✅ Use only your notes and flowcharts

 🕵️ Prioritize recon > enumeration > access > pillage > privilege escalation > lateral

 📓 Keep track of evidence as you go (screens, payloads, hashes, etc.)

 🪵 Maintain a running timeline in your report — tell the story

 🔄 Use your "Got This, Do That" trees if stuck

 🧼 Report quality > speed (you're simulating the full 72h flow)

 🎯 Don’t tunnel vision — if something doesn’t work in 45min, move on, log it, come back later

🎯 Judging Readiness (After the Run)
After AEN + report, ask:

Did I feel in control or constantly guessing?

Could I map findings to known CPTS workflows?

Was my report clear, reproducible, and actionable?

Did I finish all major sections within the 72h window?

Would I hire me based on this report?
