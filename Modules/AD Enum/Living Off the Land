Living Off the Land would be if we didnt have any tools or internet access and we could only use the tools given to us on the host machine / AD joined machine we havce access too. 
that being said these tools are normally much more stealthy than any of the tools we used earlier. 


Scenario
Let's assume our client has asked us to test their AD environment from a managed host with no internet access, and all efforts to load tools onto it have failed. Our client wants to see what types of enumeration are possible, so we'll have to resort to "living off the land" or only using tools and commands native to Windows/Active Directory. This can also be a more stealthy approach and may not create as many log entries and alerts as pulling tools into the network in previous sections. Most enterprise environments nowadays have some form of network monitoring and logging, including IDS/IPS, firewalls, and passive sensors and tools on top of their host-based defenses such as Windows Defender or enterprise EDR. Depending on the environment, they may also have tools that take a baseline of "normal" network traffic and look for anomalies. Because of this, our chances of getting caught go up exponentially when we start pulling tools into the environment from outside.
