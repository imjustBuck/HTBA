Detailed User Enumeration
To mount a successful password spraying attack, we first need a list of valid domain users to attempt to authenticate with. There are several ways that we can gather a target list of valid users:

* By leveraging an SMB NULL session to retrieve a complete list of domain users from the domain controller
* Utilizing an LDAP anonymous bind to query LDAP anonymously and pull down the domain user list
* Using a tool such as Kerbrute to validate users utilizing a word list from a source such as the statistically-likely-usernames GitHub repo, or gathered by using a tool such as linkedin2username to create a list of potentially valid users
* Using a set of credentials from a Linux or Windows attack system either provided by our client or obtained through another means such as LLMNR/NBT-NS response poisoning using Responder or even a successful password spray using a smaller wordlist



Again, if we do not know the password policy, we can always ask our client, and, if they won't provide it, we can either try one very targeted password spraying attempt as a "hail mary" if all other options for a foothold have been exhausted. We could also try one spray every few hours in an attempt to not lock out any accounts. Regardless of the method we choose, and if we have the password policy or not, we must always keep a log of our activities, including, but not limited to:

* The accounts targeted
* Domain Controller used in the attack
* Time of the spray
* Date of the spray
* Password(s) attempted


SMB NULL Session to Pull User List
If you are on an internal machine but donâ€™t have valid domain credentials, you can look for SMB NULL sessions or LDAP anonymous binds on Domain Controllers. Either of these will allow you to obtain an accurate list of all users within Active Directory and the password policy. If you already have credentials for a domain user or SYSTEM access on a Windows host, then you can easily query Active Directory for this information.


Some tools that can leverage SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds include enum4linux, rpcclient, and CrackMapExec, among others. Regardless of the tool, we'll have to do a bit of filtering to clean up the output and obtain a list of only usernames, one on each line. We can do this with enum4linux with the -U flag.

Enumerating Users with Kerbrute
As mentioned in the Initial Enumeration of The Domain section, if we have no access at all from our position in the internal network, we can use Kerbrute to enumerate valid AD accounts and for password spraying.

This tool uses Kerberos Pre-Authentication, which is a much faster and potentially stealthier way to perform password spraying. This method does not generate Windows event ID 4625: An account failed to log on, or a logon failure which is often monitored for. The tool sends TGT requests to the domain controller without Kerberos Pre-Authentication to perform username enumeration. If the KDC responds with the error PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN, the username is invalid. Whenever the KDC prompts for Kerberos Pre-Authentication, this signals that the username exists, and the tool will mark it as valid. This method of username enumeration does not cause logon failures and will not lock out accounts. However, once we have a list of valid users and switch gears to use this tool for password spraying, failed Kerberos Pre-Authentication attempts will count towards an account's failed login accounts and can lead to account lockout, so we still must be careful regardless of the method chosen.

Let's try out this method using the jsmith.txt wordlist of 48,705 possible common usernames in the format flast. The statistically-likely-usernames GitHub repo is an excellent resource for this type of attack and contains a variety of different username lists that we can use to enumerate valid usernames using Kerbrute.

Challenge -  SSH to 10.129.247.9 (ACADEMY-EA-ATTACK01) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" 


Question 1 - Enumerate valid usernames using Kerbrute and the wordlist located at /opt/jsmith.txt on the ATTACK01 host. How many valid usernames can we enumerate with just this wordlist from an unauthenticated standpoint? - 56

1) ssh in or use from last module 
2) from SSH session ->  kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt  
3) once script is finished it shows we have 56 valid usernames found
