Password spraying can result in gaining access to systems and potentially gaining a foothold on a target network. The attack involves attempting to log into an exposed service using one common password and a longer list of usernames or email addresses. The usernames and emails may have been gathered during the OSINT phase of the penetration test or our initial enumeration attempts.


Password Spraying Considerations
While password spraying is useful for a penetration tester or red teamer, careless use may cause considerable harm, such as locking out hundreds of production accounts. One example is brute-forcing attempts to identify the password for an account using a long list of passwords. In contrast, password spraying is a more measured attack, utilizing very common passwords across multiple industries. The below table visualizes a password spray.

It’s common to find a password policy that allows five bad attempts before locking out the account, with a 30-minute auto-unlock threshold. Some organizations configure more extended account lockout thresholds, even requiring an administrator to unlock the accounts manually. If you don’t know the password policy, a good rule of thumb is to wait a few hours between attempts, which should be long enough for the account lockout threshold to reset. It is best to obtain the password policy before attempting the attack during an internal assessment, but this is not always possible. We can err on the side of caution and either choose to do just one targeted password spraying attempt using a weak/common password as a "hail mary" if all other options for a foothold or furthering access have been exhausted. Depending on the type of assessment, we can always ask the client to clarify the password policy. If we already have a foothold or were provided a user account as part of testing, we can enumerate the password policy in various ways. Let's practice this in the next section.
