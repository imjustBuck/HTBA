We have discussed various methods for bypassing single-character filters. However, there are different methods when it comes to bypassing blacklisted commands. A command blacklist usually consists of a set of words, and if we can obfuscate our commands and make them look different, we may be able to bypass the filters.

There are various methods of command obfuscation that vary in complexity, as we will touch upon later with command obfuscation tools. We will cover a few basic techniques that may enable us to change the look of our command to bypass filters manually.

Commands Blacklist
We have so far successfully bypassed the character filter for the space and semi-colon characters in our payload. So, let us go back to our very first payload and re-add the whoami command to see if it gets executed:

We see that even though we used characters that are not blocked by the web application, the request gets blocked again once we added our command. This is likely due to another type of filter, which is a command blacklist filter.

A basic command blacklist filter in PHP would look like the following:

$blacklist = ['whoami', 'cat', ...SNIP...];
foreach ($blacklist as $word) {
    if (strpos('$_POST['ip']', $word) !== false) {
        echo "Invalid input";
    }
}

As we can see, it is checking each word of the user input to see if it matches any of the blacklisted words. However, this code is looking for an exact match of the provided command, so if we send a slightly different command, it may not get blocked. Luckily, we can utilize various obfuscation techniques that will execute our command without using the exact command word.

Linux & Windows
One very common and easy obfuscation technique is inserting certain characters within our command that are usually ignored by command shells like Bash or PowerShell and will execute the same command as if they were not there. Some of these characters are a single-quote ' and a double-quote ", in addition to a few others.

The easiest to use are quotes, and they work on both Linux and Windows servers. For example, if we want to obfuscate the whoami command, we can insert single quotes between its characters, as follows:

SYNTAX: 
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ w'h'o'am'i

21y4d

SYNTAX: 
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ w"h"o"am"i

21y4d
