🔥 Pass-the-Ticket from Linux - Summary (CPTS Style)
🧠 Core Concept:
Linux machines can integrate with Active Directory using Kerberos.

If Kerberos tickets are stored locally (ccache or keytab), you can steal/use them to impersonate users (PtT).

These tickets may live on joined Linux machines, or even on non-joined ones used to interact with AD via Kerberos.

Abuse is about finding, importing, and using those ticket files.

🛠️ “Got This, Do That” - PtT from Linux Workflow
✅ You’ve Gained Access to a Linux Host?
Check if it’s AD-integrated:

perl
Copy
Edit
realm list
ps -ef | grep -i "sssd\|winbind"
✅ Want to Find Stored Kerberos Tickets?
Look for keytab files:

javascript
Copy
Edit
find / -name *keytab* 2>/dev/null
Look for ccache files (Kerberos session tickets):

bash
Copy
Edit
env | grep -i krb5
ls -la /tmp | grep krb5cc
📂 Found a .keytab file?
Use klist -k -t path/to/file.keytab to list contents.

Use kinit user@REALM -k -t path/to/file.keytab to impersonate.

Run klist to verify you’ve taken over the session.

Now, try lateral movement (e.g., smbclient, evil-winrm, impacket-wmiexec, etc.).

📂 Found a .ccache file?
Copy it and export it:

bash
Copy
Edit
export KRB5CCNAME=/path/to/krb5cc_xxx
klist   # confirm ticket details
Use the ticket directly in impacket-* tools or smbclient:

bash
Copy
Edit
smbclient //dc01/share -k -no-pass
👨‍💻 Trying to Use the Ticket Externally from Your Kali/Parrot Box?
Setup proxy access to the internal DC (Chisel, Proxychains, etc.).

Modify /etc/hosts and /etc/proxychains.conf.

Set KRB5CCNAME to ticket path.

Then:

nginx
Copy
Edit
proxychains impacket-wmiexec dc01 -k -no-pass
🔁 Decision Tree
Got This	Do That
Found .keytab	Use klist to ID user → use kinit to import → lateral movement
Found .ccache	export KRB5CCNAME=... → klist to confirm → use Kerberos-aware tools
Have root on host	Check /tmp for all user krb5cc_* files
Ticket expired?	Cannot use, try to reinit with creds or extract password from keytab
Want plaintext creds?	Use keytabextract.py on .keytab → Crack with hashcat or online repo
Want to use ticket on Windows	Convert ccache → .kirbi using impacket-ticketConverter
Want to use .kirbi in Windows	Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:julio.kirbi
🧩 Patterns & Hints
KEYTABs = persistent Kerberos auth without user input (scripts, cronjobs).

CCACHE = session ticket store; temporary but gold for lateral movement.

klist is your friend to validate who you’re impersonating.

Always check for group memberships (id user) → Domain Admins = game over.

From Linux: smbclient, impacket-*, evil-winrm, all support -k for Kerberos.

FILE: prefix in KRB5CCNAME may need to be stripped when using Impacket.

🚩 Red Flags to Check
Are you root? If yes, you can hijack anyone’s session (read ccache, keytab).

Ticket expiration? klist tells you.

No realm? Check ps -ef or config files (/etc/krb5.conf, /etc/sssd/, etc.).

Cracked password from .keytab? Log in directly with ssh or su - username.

🧠 Tools Recap
kinit, klist, keytabextract.py → manipulate tickets.

smbclient -k, proxychains impacket-* -k, evil-winrm -k → abuse access.

chisel, proxychains, /etc/hosts → for off-host use.

linikatz.sh → extract all tickets (Mimikatz for Linux).

impacket-ticketConverter → cross-platform ticket use.

🔍 When Would You PtT From Linux to an AD Device?
Here’s when it really matters:

✅ Scenario 1: You’re on a Linux machine joined to AD and escalate to root
You check /tmp or KRB5CCNAME, find someone’s valid ticket (ccache).

That user might be Domain Admin or have RDP, SMB, or other access to important boxes.

You PtT with their ticket to move laterally to Windows assets (SMB, WinRM, etc.).

Real-world version: Think a misconfigured Linux DevOps box, joined to AD with SSSD. An engineer logs in, does their thing, and leaves a valid ticket behind. You snatch it and bounce to DC01 or a share server.

✅ Scenario 2: You’re attacking from your Kali box (non-joined) but gain a ticket
You transferred .ccache or .kirbi from a compromised Linux host.

You now want to use it against AD resources (but you’re not domain-joined).

Use Chisel + Proxychains + Kerberos-aware tools (impacket-wmiexec, evil-winrm, etc.) to use the ticket via the -k flag.

✅ Scenario 3: You crack a .keytab and want to impersonate the user
Keytabs might be used by scripts or services.

Once cracked (or even without cracking, if kinit works), you generate a ticket as them and proceed to laterally move using SMB, LDAP, etc.

🎯 Is the Main Difference Just the Tools Used?
Yes, main difference = tooling and a bit of setup:

From Windows	From Linux
Rubeus to import .kirbi	export KRB5CCNAME for .ccache
klist (Win) for tickets	klist, kinit, keytabextract.py
Rubeus or Mimikatz tooling	impacket-*, smbclient -k, linikatz
Native ticket caching	File-based ticket caching
But same core mechanics — Kerberos ticket = proof of identity. As long as it’s valid, the OS (and apps using Kerberos) trusts it.

🕓 Is It Just Making Sure the Ticket Is Valid in klist?
💯 That’s the critical checkpoint before using a ticket.

When you klist, always confirm:

✅ Valid starting time is not in the future (happens if clock skew).

✅ Expires time hasn’t passed.

✅ You see the krbtgt/REALM@REALM — means it’s a TGT.

✅ It belongs to a juicy user (Domain Admin? File share access?).

If all checks out → you can pass that ticket to pretty much anything Kerberos-aware:

smbclient, impacket-wmiexec, evil-winrm, ldapsearch, etc.

🧠 Bonus Situational Tip
If you're mid-pivot and can't use NTLM because of firewalling or segmentation, Kerberos (PtT) over proxychains might be your only way in — since it’s port 88 + ticket-based auth.
