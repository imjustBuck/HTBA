🔍 Credential Hunting in Windows – Mindset and Flow
🧠 Goal:
Once we land on a box (GUI or CLI), go fishing for creds — think:

IT admins write stuff down.

Apps store creds poorly.

You're already in. Time to loot.

🔍 Phase 1: "Search-Centric" Recon
Ask yourself:
“What would an IT admin be doing here?”

RDP?

Accessing servers?

Remote backups?

Web app admin panels?

KeePass?

Scripting?

🔑 Key Terms to Hunt For
Use these in file searches (GUI or findstr):

text
Copy
Edit
password passphrase pwd creds credentials login key passkey
dbcredential dbpassword configuration username useraccount
🛠️ Phase 2: Tools to Use
🖥️ GUI
Use Windows Search Bar — type:

pass

pwd

credentials

🔍 findstr (CLI File Search)
Great for plaintext hunting:

cmd
Copy
Edit
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
/S – recursive through directories

/I – case-insensitive

/M – return just the filenames (optional)

/C:"string" – match exact string

🐍 LaZagne (Rapid Dump of Stored App Creds)
Steps:

Transfer LaZagne.exe to target via RDP or SMB share

Run in PowerShell or CMD:

cmd
Copy
Edit
lazagne.exe all -vv
🔍 -vv = see detailed process (modules it checks)

Outputs creds from:

WinSCP

Chrome

Outlook

RDP Manager

Firefox

And much more

📁 Phase 3: Where to Look (Manually)
🔐 Hot Cred Dumping Zones
Location / File	Description
SYSVOL GPO scripts	GPP passwords, deploy scripts
web.config	Often stores DB/user creds in dev/test
unattend.xml	Leftover install scripts w/ admin creds
KeePass .kdbx	Pull + crack for vault access
C:\Users\*\Documents	Look for txt, xlsx, docx creds
Shares / IT folders	Hardcoded creds in scripts
AD Description field	Lazy admin notes with passwords
Example File Types to Search:
text
Copy
Edit
*.xml *.config *.txt *.ps1 *.ini *.bat *.vbs *.py *.json

### Credential Hunting Checklist:

✅ Check user Desktop / Documents for:
   - pass.txt / creds.xlsx
   - Notes / screenshots / KeePass

✅ Run `findstr` for keyword scans

✅ Drop + run `LaZagne.exe` all -vv

✅ Manually check:
   - SYSVOL
   - web.config files
   - ProgramData folders (like RDPman)
   - Startup scripts / batch files
   - KeePass DBs
   - Outlook / browser stored creds

✅ Bonus: Check registry for saved creds (Google it 😉)

✅ If GUI access: Use File Explorer's search bar
🧠 Real Talk:
This part is often the difference between 1 user and domain-wide access. People suck at storing passwords — your job is to catch the slip-ups. Treat every system like it might be carrying plaintext gold.
