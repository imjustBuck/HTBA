The company Inlanefreight has contracted you to perform a web application assessment against one of their public-facing websites. In light of a recent breach of one of their main competitors, they are particularly concerned with SQL injection vulnerabilities and the damage the discovery and successful exploitation of this attack could do to their public image and bottom line.

They provided a target IP address and no further information about their website. Perform a full assessment of the web application from a "grey box" approach, checking for the existence of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Question 1 - Assess the web application and use a variety of techniques to gain remote code execution and find a flag in the / root directory of the file system. Submit the contents of the flag as your answer.
