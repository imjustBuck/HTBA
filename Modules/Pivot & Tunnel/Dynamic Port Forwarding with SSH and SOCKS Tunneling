Port Forwarding in Context
Port forwarding is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another.
Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port.
However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even SOCKS (non-application layer) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. 
This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.

Scanning the Pivot: 

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sT -p22,3306 10.129.202.64

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-24 12:12 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.202.64
Host is up (0.12s latency).

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
3306/tcp closed mysql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.68 seconds

The Nmap output shows that the SSH port is open. 
To access the MySQL service, we can either SSH into the server and access MySQL from inside the Ubuntu server, or we can port forward it to our localhost on port 1234 and access it locally. 
A benefit of accessing it locally is if we want to execute a remote exploit on the MySQL service, we won't be able to do it without port forwarding.
This is due to MySQL being hosted locally on the Ubuntu server on port 3306. 
So, we will use the below command to forward our local port (1234) over SSH to the Ubuntu serve

Executing the Local Port Forward

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64

************ The -L command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port 1234 to localhost:3306 on the Ubuntu server.
By doing this, we should be able to access the MySQL service locally on port 1234. 
We can use Netstat or Nmap to query our local host on 1234 port to verify whether the MySQL service was forwarded.

Similarly, if we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, you can do so by including the local port:server:port argument to your ssh command
For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on 8080.

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64

Unlike the previous scenario where we knew which port to access, in our current scenario, we don't know which services lie on the other side of the network. So, we can scan smaller ranges of IPs on the network (172.16.5.1-200) network or the entire subnet (172.16.5.0/23). We cannot perform this scan directly from our attack host because it does not have routes to the 172.16.5.0/23 network. To do this, we will have to perform dynamic port forwarding and pivot our network packets via the Ubuntu server. We can do this by starting a SOCKS listener on our local host (personal attack host or Pwnbox) and then configure SSH to forward that traffic via SSH to the network (172.16.5.0/23) after connecting to the target host.


So we have to set up a SOCKS Listener first on our LOCAL / HOST machine then configure SSH to forward that traffic VIA ssh to the victim network AFTER connecting to target host. 

  Scenario Overview
We need to scan a network (172.16.5.0/23) that our attack host cannot directly access. To do so, we use SSH tunneling over a SOCKS proxy via a compromised Ubuntu server. This process allows us to "pivot" traffic through the Ubuntu server to reach the restricted network.

Steps to Accomplish This
1. Setup a SOCKS Proxy on Your Local Machine

- Goal: Create a listener that forwards traffic from your attack machine to the restricted network.
- How: Use SSH to set up dynamic port forwarding.

Example command:

Syntax: ssh -D 1080 -f -N user@ubuntu-target  -> ON HOST MACHINE 

Explanation:
-D 1080: Sets up a SOCKS proxy on port 1080 of your attack host.
-f: Runs the SSH process in the background.
-N: No remote command execution; just tunneling.
user@ubuntu-target: SSH into the Ubuntu server (pivot point).
+
2. Configure Your Tools to Use the SOCKS Proxy

-Goal: Route your scanning or enumeration tools' traffic through the SOCKS proxy.
-How: Use tools like proxychains or set up a browser/tool to use the SOCKS proxy (e.g., localhost:1080).

Example proxychains usage:
Syntax: proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -p 22,80,443 172.16.5.0/23 -> ON HOST MACHINE 
Explanation:
- proxychains: Ensures traffic is routed through the SOCKS proxy.
- nmap: Scans the restricted network via the SOCKS proxy.

3. Perform Enumeration/Scanning on the Target Network

- Goal: Scan or access services on the restricted network (172.16.5.0/23).
- How: Once the SOCKS proxy is set, you can enumerate the network using your scanning tools or even browse web servers behind the NAT.

Why This Works:
The SOCKS proxy routes your traffic from your attack host -> Ubuntu server -> restricted network.

- Key Concepts Explained
  SOCKS Proxy:
- Acts as a middleman to route your traffic through an intermediary host.
- Useful when firewalls or NAT restrict direct access.
- Dynamic Port Forwarding:

The SSH command sets up a tunnel to the target network and forwards any traffic (via the SOCKS proxy) to it.
Benefits:

Bypass firewalls or NAT restrictions.
Conduct scans and enumeration on networks otherwise unreachable.


What You Need:

1) Access to the Victim Machine (Pivot Point):

* You need valid credentials (username/password or private key) to SSH into the victim machine (e.g., the Ubuntu server).
* This machine has access to the restricted network (e.g., 172.16.5.0/23).

2) The Restricted Network’s IP Range:

* This is the target subnet you want to scan or interact with (e.g., 172.16.5.0/23).

3) Your Host Machine (Attack Machine):

* This is where you set up the SOCKS proxy (ssh -D) and run tools like nmap through proxychains.

Key Points to Avoid Confusion:

* The SOCKS Proxy is Local: The SOCKS proxy (ssh -D 1080) runs on your host machine. You don’t need to install or configure anything on the victim machine for this.
* The Victim Machine is a Middleman: The victim machine (Ubuntu server) simply forwards the traffic from your host machine to the restricted network.

Why You Only Need the Victim’s Network IP Range:

* Your tools (e.g., nmap, curl, etc.) will generate traffic from your host machine.
* The SOCKS proxy ensures that traffic is tunneled through the victim machine and forwarded to the target network.
* As long as the victim machine has access to the target network, and you know the IP range, your host machine can interact with it via the SOCKS proxy.

Steps Recap:

1) Set Up the SOCKS Proxy (on Host Machine):

Syntax: ssh -D 1080 -f -N user@ubuntu-target

* This forwards all traffic from your host machine through the victim machine.

2) Configure Proxychains (on Host Machine):

Edit /etc/proxychains.conf and ensure the last line points to the SOCKS proxy:
Syntax for /etc/proxchains.conf: socks5 127.0.0.1 1080

3) Run Tools Through Proxychains (on Host Machine):

Syntax: proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -p 22,80,443 172.16.5.0/23

*This command scans the restricted network from your host machine via the victim machine.

Why This Works:

* The victim machine acts as a gateway to the restricted network. Your host machine doesn't need direct access to the restricted network—it just needs the victim machine to forward its traffic.

Example Scenario:
Your host machine: 10.10.14.20
Victim machine (Ubuntu server): 192.168.1.10
Target network (restricted): 172.16.5.0/23
The workflow is:

You SSH into the victim machine (192.168.1.10).
Set up a SOCKS proxy on your host machine.
Use proxychains to scan 172.16.5.0/23 through the victim machine.


### Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH: 

1. Set Up the SOCKS Proxy via SSH

Command: ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64

* What this does:
* The -D 9050 flag sets up a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 on your host machine.
* This proxy forwards any traffic received on port 9050 through the SSH connection to the remote machine (10.129.202.64).
* This step enables you to use the victim machine as a gateway to reach other networks (e.g., 172.16.5.0/23).

2. Configure Proxychains
Edit the Configuration File:

Syntax: sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf
1) Add the Proxy:
* Ensure the last line reads: bsocks4 127.0.0.1 9050
* This tells Proxychains to route traffic through the SOCKS proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:9050.

3. Verify the Proxychains Configuration
Command to check: tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf
Expected Output:
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4 127.0.0.1 9050

4. Run Scans Through Proxychains
* Command for Network Scanning: proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200
* What this does: proxychains routes the traffic from nmap through the SOCKS proxy (port 9050) to the target network (172.16.5.1-200).
* The -sn flag performs a ping scan to check which hosts are alive on the target network.

5. Perform Full Scans Through Proxychains
* Command for Detailed Scan: proxychains nmap -v -Pn -sT 172.16.5.19
* What this does: The -Pn flag disables host discovery (useful if ICMP is blocked, as is often the case with Windows targets).
* The -sT flag performs a full TCP connect scan, which Proxychains supports.

6. Analyze Results

*What You’re Looking For:
*Open ports in the target network.
*In the example, ports like 445, 135, 3389, and 139 are discovered on 172.16.5.19.


7. Key Points to Remember:
* Why Use Proxychains?

* Proxychains allows you to route traffic through the SOCKS proxy set up on your host machine, effectively tunneling through the victim machine.
* It hides your host machine’s IP address, making the victim machine appear as the source of the traffic.

Why Use Full TCP Scans?

* Proxychains doesn’t support partial scans (e.g., SYN scans) because it can’t interpret partial packets. Use -sT for compatibility.
* Why Disable Ping (-Pn)? -> Many environments block ICMP (ping) requests, especially Windows hosts with default firewall settings. Disabling ping ensures you still scan the host.
