Plink, short for PuTTY Link, is a Windows command-line SSH tool that comes as a part of the PuTTY package when installed. Similar to SSH, Plink can also be used to create dynamic port forwards and SOCKS proxies. Before the Fall of 2018, Windows did not have a native ssh client included, so users would have to install their own. The tool of choice for many a sysadmin who needed to connect to other hosts was PuTTY.


Example: Imagine that we are on a pentest and gain access to a Windows machine. We quickly enumerate the host and its security posture and determine that it is moderately locked down. We need to use this host as a pivot point, but it is unlikely that we will be able to pull our own tools onto the host without being exposed. Instead, we can live off the land and use what is already there. If the host is older and PuTTY is present (or we can find a copy on a file share), Plink can be our path to victory. We can use it to create our pivot and potentially avoid detection a little longer.

i know we cant see the diagram in here but :The Windows attack host starts a plink.exe process with the below command-line arguments to start a dynamic port forward over the Ubuntu server. This starts an SSH session between the Windows attack host and the Ubuntu server, and then plink starts listening on port 9050.

Using Plink: 

Syntax on Windows (i think) : plink -ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.15.50

Another Windows-based tool called Proxifier can be used to start a SOCKS tunnel via the SSH session we created. Proxifier is a Windows tool that creates a tunneled network for desktop client applications and allows it to operate through a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy and allows for proxy chaining. It is possible to create a profile where we can provide the configuration for our SOCKS server started by Plink on port 9050

side note: i think im forgetting to always be RDP'd into a windows box with the victor:pass@123 creds we were given in one of the first rooms and thats why im always so confused with these boxes...
