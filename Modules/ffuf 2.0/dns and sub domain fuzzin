🔁 Big Picture Flow:
/blog says admin panel moved to academy.htb ✅

You can’t access academy.htb until you add it to /etc/hosts

Same logic applies to any subdomains like admin.academy.htb — they won’t resolve publicly

🔐 Why No Hits During Subdomain Fuzz?
Ffuf uses DNS to resolve FUZZ.academy.htb

But only academy.htb is in /etc/hosts

So anything like admin.academy.htb → fails with "couldn’t resolve"

🧠 Key Fix (and what you’ll do next):
To discover subdomains on private boxes, you need to:

Option A – Manual Subdomain Discovery from Clues
If /blog says "Admin panel at admin.academy.htb"

You just manually add it:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "10.10.10.123 admin.academy.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
Option B – Wordlist + Hosts File
If you’re fuzzing for subdomains, and want them to resolve locally, then:

Loop through the wordlist manually and add promising ones

OR create a little script that auto-adds:

bash
Copy
Edit
for sub in $(cat subdomains-top1million-5000.txt); do
  echo "10.10.10.123 $sub.academy.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
done
(This gets messy fast though — better for testing 5-10 likely subs than dumping 5000)

🔑 Takeaway TL;DR:
Public DNS fuzzing won’t help with private HTB domains

If you get a “connection error”, it’s not a 404 — it’s a DNS fail

You must manually add subdomains to /etc/hosts before fuzzing or visiting
