🧠 Concept Recap: VHost vs Subdomain
Subdomain fuzzing relies on public DNS — if it's not published, it won't resolve.

VHost fuzzing sends requests directly to the IP with different Host: headers, tricking the server into revealing which internal vhosts exist.

✅ When to Use VHost Fuzzing
Got This?

You have an IP + domain (e.g. academy.htb)

You've already added it to /etc/hosts

You suspect there's a vhost like admin.academy.htb

Regular subdomain fuzzing didn’t return anything

Do That:
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ \
-u http://academy.htb:PORT/ \
-H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb' \
-c -v
🎯 How Do I Know I Found Something?
When you run that fuzz:

Most responses will have the same size/status — likely all 200 OK with the same size.

When a VHost is valid, the response will stand out by:

Having a different size

Possibly redirecting (302)

Or even showing unique titles/content

💡 Use -fs to filter out repeated junk like:

bash
Copy
Edit
-fs 900  # Filter size 900 if all default junk responses are 900 bytes
🧪 Example of a Successful Hit:
Let’s say the following line pops up:

yaml
Copy
Edit
admin                   [Status: 200, Size: 1732, Words: 201, Lines: 36]
While all others are:

yaml
Copy
Edit
xyz                     [Status: 200, Size: 900, Words: 90, Lines: 12]
🟢 That Size: 1732 is the odd one out = likely a real VHost.

🛠️ Tip for Real Engagements or Exams:
Once you find a valid VHost like admin.academy.htb, immediately do:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo echo "IP admin.academy.htb" >> /etc/hosts
Then revisit it in the browser or curl it to test for login portals, APIs, etc.

🥊 Subdomain vs Virtual Host (VHost) — What's the Difference?
Concept	Subdomain	VHost
Definition	A DNS record (e.g. admin.site.com) that maps to an IP.	A server config that hosts multiple domains on the same IP (name-based virtual hosting).
Discovery Tool	DNS-based (public or internal DNS).	Header-based (by manipulating the Host: header).
Depends On	Public DNS records or internal DNS resolution.	Web server configuration — not DNS.
Example	api.google.com → resolves via DNS.	admin.site.local → doesn’t resolve unless added to /etc/hosts, but still served by Apache/Nginx.
Common Usage	Real-world, public-facing domains.	Internal apps, staging, dev panels, admin portals.
How to Fuzz	Replace FUZZ in the URL (e.g. http://FUZZ.site.com).	Replace FUZZ in the Host header, hitting the IP or base domain.
🚦 When to Use Subdomain Fuzzing
Use this when:

✅ The domain is public or resolves (e.g. academy.htb)
✅ You want to see what DNS records exist
✅ You're mapping a wider external attack surface
✅ You can hit the internet or internal DNS

bash
Copy
Edit
ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u http://FUZZ.site.com/
🧠 Real-world example: Trying to find dev, staging, or admin on a publicly hosted site? Use this.

🕵️‍♂️ When to Use VHost Fuzzing
Use this when:

✅ You're dealing with a box IP or one domain only
✅ Subdomain fuzzing gave you nothing
✅ You're in an internal pentest, HTB-style lab, or CTF
✅ You suspect name-based virtual hosting

bash
Copy
Edit
ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H "Host: FUZZ.academy.htb"
🧠 Real-world example: academy.htb resolves, but nothing cool is found. You send Host: admin.academy.htb — the box says “welcome admin” = jackpot. Now add it to /etc/hosts.

⚔️ TL;DR — Got This? Do That
Situation	Tool/Method
You have a domain and want to find what DNS subdomains exist	Use subdomain fuzzing with FUZZ.domain.com
You have a domain or IP, and suspect other sites might be served from the same host	Use vhost fuzzing with -H "Host: FUZZ.domain.com"
You get a message like “Admin panel moved to admin.site”	Try vhost fuzzing or manually add to /etc/hosts
Subdomain fuzzing returns nothing, but you suspect there's more	Flip to vhost fuzzing — always try both if in doubt
