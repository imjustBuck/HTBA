🧠 If This, Then FFUF That — Directory Fuzzing
🧩 Situation	🧨 What To Do
You’re testing a root URL and want to see what folders exist	Fuzz /FUZZ with a directory list
You get back HTTP 200/301/302	Directory probably exists — try visiting it
You get a hit like /blog but it looks empty	It may have hidden subpages — enumerate deeper in next steps
You get a ton of 403s	Consider filtering them with -fc 403 or checking if there's an index.html missing
Response is always the same size (e.g., size 42)	Use -fs 42 to filter out false positives
Target is slow or rate-limiting	Decrease threads (-t 20), use delay, or try -rate flag
🛠️ FFUF Workflow: First Pass Fuzz
bash
Copy
Edit
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ \
     -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ \
     -fc 404 -t 40 -o scan-root-dir.txt
This will:

Fuzz for root directories

Ignore 404 pages

Run with 40 threads (balanced speed)

Output to a file

🚦 Response Status Code Meanings in FFUF
Status	Meaning
200	Valid page
301/302	Redirect — usually valid path
403	Forbidden (may still exist)
404	Not Found (usually ignored)
500	Internal error (could be exploitable)
✅ Confirming Hits
Once you get something like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
blog                    [Status: 301, Size: 326, Words: 20, Lines: 10]
You visit:

http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog

🛠️ FFUF Command – Fuzzing Inside /blog/
bash
Copy
Edit
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt:FUZZ \
     -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/FUZZ \
     -fc 404 -t 40 -o blog-subdir-scan.txt
🔍 Breakdown:
Option	Meaning
-w	Using common.txt since we’re looking for files/pages now, not massive discovery
-u	URL target: /blog/FUZZ
-fc 404	Filter out “Not Found” pages
-t 40	40 threads for good speed
-o	Save results to file for reference or report writing
🧠 If This, Then That for /blog/ Scan
| Found /blog/login | Try common creds or test for auth bypass (hint: SQLi 👀) | | Found /blog/admin | Look for misconfigs or broken access control | | Found /blog/index.php.bak | Jackpot – could reveal code | | Found /blog/config | Possible static secrets or backup | | Found nothing | Try bigger wordlist or check for case sensitivity, e.g., Blog, BLOG |
