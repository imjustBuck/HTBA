üîÅ If This, Then That: Extension & Page Fuzzing
Situation	Action
index.php exists	‚úÖ Confirm server is PHP-based ‚Äî now switch to .php file fuzzing
index.html exists	Could be static site ‚Äî use .html or try looking for JS/hidden input
Extension test returns 403	Try requesting as curl -A 'Googlebot' or switch user agents
No extensions found	Try extensionless fuzzing: /blog/FUZZ
Found .php file	Add to report, visit directly, test for GET/POST params, auth, etc.
Found .phps or .bak	üì¢ ALERT: Possible source code or backup disclosure
File returns 200 OK with non-zero content	Validate manually ‚Äì could contain creds, logic flaws, hidden fields, etc.
üõ†Ô∏è Wordlists & When to Use Them
Wordlist	Use Case
/directory-list-2.3-small.txt	General directory or PHP file brute-forcing
/web-extensions.txt	Finding backend technologies (e.g., .php, .aspx, .jsp)
common.txt	Faster and lighter than full 2.3 list; good for second-pass scans
raft-small-files.txt	Great for targeting backup files, logs, configs
cms-specific wordlists	If you know it's WordPress, Joomla, etc., use targeted lists
‚ö° Pro Tip: Double FUZZ
If you‚Äôre ever unsure what file and what extension might exist, try:

bash
Copy
Edit
ffuf -w filenames.txt:FILE -w extensions.txt:EXT -u http://IP:PORT/FUZZ -u http://IP:PORT/FILE.EXT
This way you can go after stuff like admin.php, backup.bak, or index.old.
