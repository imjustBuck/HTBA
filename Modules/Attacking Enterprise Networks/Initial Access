Now that we've thoroughly enumerated and attacked the external perimeter and uncovered a wealth of findings, we're ready to shift gears and focus on obtaining stable internal network access. Per the SoW document, if we can achieve an internal foothold, the client would like us to see how far we can go up to and including gaining Domain Admin level access. In the last section, we worked hard on peeling apart the layers and finding web apps that led to early file read or remote code execution but didn't get us into the internal network. We left off with obtaining RCE on the monitoring.inlanefreight.local application after a hard-fought battle against filters and blacklists set in place to try to prevent Command Injection attacks.
