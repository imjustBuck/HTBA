At this point, we have moved from the Information Gathering and Vulnerability Assessment stages into the Exploitation stage of the Penetration Testing Process. After obtaining a foothold, we enumerated what hosts were available to us, scanned for open ports, and probed the accessible services.

Attacking DNN
Let's head over to DNN and try our luck with the credential pair Administrator:D0tn31Nuk3R0ck$$@123. This is a success; we are logged in as the SuperUser administrator account. Here we would want to record another two high-risk findings: Insecure File Shares and Sensitive Data on File Shares. We could potentially combine these into one, but it's worth highlighting as separate issues because if the client restricts anonymous access, but all Domain Users can still access the share and see data that is not necessary for their day-to-day work, then there is a still a risk present.
