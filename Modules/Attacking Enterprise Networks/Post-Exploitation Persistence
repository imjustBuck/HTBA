so now we have srvadm creds we can SSH in with the openports we found before. this will also allow us to proxychains traffic and pivot and tunnel around much better than a webshell. 

the section then continues to talk about linpeas and sudo - l for priv esec as well as GTFOBin (https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/openssl/) for what we find when we run sudo -l

1) ssh srvadm@10.129.248.159
