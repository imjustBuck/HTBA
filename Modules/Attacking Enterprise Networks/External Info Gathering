So this is kinda just putting everything together we learned into larger sections themeselves so were going to just start at challenges ( unless theres new information that presents itself ) and work from there 



CHALLENGE:

vHosts needed for these questions:
inlanefreight.local

Question 1 -  Perform a banner grab of the services listening on the target host and find a non-standard service banner. Submit the name as your answer (format: word_word_word) - 1337_HTB_DNS 
1) nano scope -> put Target IP in ther efor us it was 10.129.229.147
2) sudo nmap --open -p- -A -oA inlanefreight_ept_tcp_all_svc -iL scope
3) output : 53/tcp   open  domain   (unknown banner: 1337_HTB_DNS)
4) we can also ftp in anonmoymous and theres a flag.txt i see so lets just get it real quick. 
5) ftp 10.129.229.147 -> anonymous -> get flag.txt -> exit
6) cat flag.txt -> HTB{0eb0ab788df18c3115ac43b1c06ae6c4}


Question 2 -  Perform a DNS Zone Transfer against the target and find a flag. Submit the flag value as your answer (flag format: HTB{ }). - HTB{DNs_ZOn3_Tr@nsf3r}
1) dig axfr inlanefreight.local @10.129.229.147 
2) output : inlanefreight.local.	86400	IN	SOA	ns1.inlanfreight.local. dnsadmin.inlanefreight.local. 21 604800 86400 2419200 86400
inlanefreight.local.	86400	IN	NS	inlanefreight.local.
inlanefreight.local.	86400	IN	A	127.0.0.1
blog.inlanefreight.local. 86400	IN	A	127.0.0.1
careers.inlanefreight.local. 86400 IN	A	127.0.0.1
dev.inlanefreight.local. 86400	IN	A	127.0.0.1
flag.inlanefreight.local. 86400	IN	TXT	"HTB{DNs_ZOn3_Tr@nsf3r}"
gitlab.inlanefreight.local. 86400 IN	A	127.0.0.1
ir.inlanefreight.local.	86400	IN	A	127.0.0.1
status.inlanefreight.local. 86400 IN	A	127.0.0.1
support.inlanefreight.local. 86400 IN	A	127.0.0.1
tracking.inlanefreight.local. 86400 IN	A	127.0.0.1
vpn.inlanefreight.local. 86400	IN	A	127.0.0.1
inlanefreight.local.	86400	IN	SOA	ns1.inlanfreight.local. dnsadmin.inlanefreight.local. 21 604800 86400 2419200 86400

3) so yes we have our flag but its also a good idea to add all these subdoamins into our /etc/hosts file. 



Question 3 -   What is the FQDN of the associated subdomain? - 
1) from above output we see FQDN is - flag.inlanefreight.local 


Question 4 - Perform vhost discovery. What additional vhost exists? (one word) - monitoring
1) ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://10.129.229.147/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.inlanefreight.local'
2) clear clutter -> ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://10.129.229.147/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.inlanefreight.local' -fs 15157
3) output we see monitoring.inlanefreight.local was the additional one found
