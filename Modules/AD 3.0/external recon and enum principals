Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform external reconnaissance of your target. This can serve many different functions, such as:

Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials
Think of it like this; we are trying to get the lay of the land to ensure we provide the most comprehensive test possible for our customer.

What Are We Looking For?
When conducting our external reconnaissance, there are several key items that we should be looking for. This information may not always be publicly accessible, but it would be prudent to see what is out there. If we get stuck during a penetration test, looking back at what could be obtained through passive recon can give us that nudge needed to move forward, such as password breach data that could be used to access a VPN or other externally facing service. The table below highlights the "What" in what we would be searching for during this phase of our engagement.

so what exactly are we looking for: 

Data Point	                                                          Description
IP Space  	                                                          Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.

Domain Information	                                                  Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)
Schema Format	Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.

Data Disclosures	                                                    For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain intranet site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.)

Breach Data	                                                          Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.


now that we have are what and why, lets figure out our where and how 

Where Are We Looking?
Our list of data points above can be gathered in many different ways. There are many different websites and tools that can provide us with some or all of the information above that we could use to obtain information vital to our assessment. The table below lists a few potential resources and examples that can be used.



Resource	                                                Examples
ASN / IP registrars	                                      IANA, arin for searching the Americas, RIPE for searching in Europe, BGP Toolkit

Domain Registrars & DNS	                                  Domaintools, PTRArchive, ICANN, manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as 8.8.8.8.

Social Media	                                            Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization.

Public-Facing Company Websites	                          Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.

Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces	                              GitHub, AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers, Google searches using "Dorks"

Breach Data Sources	                                      HaveIBeenPwned to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, Dehashed to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.



DNS records from however you want to find them whether via websites or command line.

Job postings showing the software adn type of companies they are 

google dorking for email addresses and naming conventions are all also big ways to gather external info.
