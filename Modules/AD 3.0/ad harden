Hardening Active Directory
Let's take some time to look at a few hardening measures that can be put in place to stop common TTPs like those we utilized in this module from being successful or providing any helpful information. Our goal as penetration testers is to help provide a better operational picture of our customers' network to their defenders and help improve their security posture. So we should understand some of the common defense tactics that can be implemented and how they would affect the networks we are assessing. These basic hardening steps will do much more for an organization (regardless of size) than purchasing the next big EDR or SIEM tool. Those extra defensive measures and equipment only help if you have a baseline security posture with features like logging enabled and proper documentation and tracking of the hosts within the network.

Step One: Document and Audit
Proper AD hardening can keep attackers contained and prevent lateral movement, privilege escalation, and access to sensitive data and resources. One of the essential steps in AD hardening is understanding everything present in your AD environment. An audit of everything listed below should be done annually, if not every few months, to ensure your records are up to date. We care about:

Things To Document and Track
Naming conventions of OUs, computers, users, groups
DNS, network, and DHCP configurations
An intimate understanding of all GPOs and the objects that they are applied to
Assignment of FSMO roles
Full and current application inventory
A list of all enterprise hosts and their location
Any trust relationships we have with other domains or outside entities
Users who have elevated permissions
People, Processes, and Technology
AD hardening can be broken out into the categories People, Process, and Technology. These hardening measures will encompass the hardware, software, and human aspects of any network.

People
In even the most hardened environment, users remain the weakest link. Enforcing security best practices for standard users and administrators will prevent "easy wins" for pentesters and malicious attackers. We should also strive to keep our users educated and aware of threats to themselves. The measures below are a great way to start securing the Human element of an AD environment.

The organization should have a strong password policy, with a password filter that disallows the use of common words (i.e., welcome, password, names of months/days/seasons, and the company name). If possible, an enterprise password manager should be used to assist users with choosing and using complex passwords.
Rotate passwords periodically for all service accounts.
Disallow local administrator access on user workstations unless a specific business need exists.
Disable the default RID-500 local admin account and create a new admin account for administration subject to LAPS password rotation.
Implement split tiers of administration for administrative users. Too often, during an assessment, you will gain access to Domain Administrator credentials on a computer that an administrator uses for all work activities.
Clean up privileged groups. Does the organization need 50+ Domain/Enterprise Admins? Restrict group membership in highly privileged groups to only those users who require this access to perform their day-to-day system administrator duties.
Where appropriate, place accounts in the Protected Users group.
Disable Kerberos delegation for administrative accounts (the Protected Users group may not do this)
Protected Users Group
The Protected Users group first appeared with Window Server 2012 R2. This group can be used to restrict what members of this privileged group can do in a domain. Adding users to Protected Users prevents user credentials from being abused if left in memory on a host.

Viewing the Protected Users Group with Get-ADGroup
  Hardening Active Directory
PS C:\Users\htb-student> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Protected Users" -Properties Name,Description,Members


Description       : Members of this group are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats.

The group provides the following Domain Controller and device protections:

Group members can not be delegated with constrained or unconstrained delegation.
CredSSP will not cache plaintext credentials in memory even if Allow delegating default credentials is set within Group Policy.
Windows Digest will not cache the user's plaintext password, even if Windows Digest is enabled.
Members cannot authenticate using NTLM authentication or use DES or RC4 keys.
After acquiring a TGT, the user's long-term keys or plaintext credentials are not cached.
Members cannot renew a TGT longer than the original 4-hour TTL.
Note: The Protected Users group can cause unforeseen issues with authentication, which can easily result in account lockouts. An organization should never place all privileged users in this group without staged testing.

Along with ensuring your users cannot cause harm to themselves, we should consider our policies and procedures for domain access and control.

Processes
Maintaining and enforcing policies and procedures that can significantly impact an organization's overall security posture is necessary. Without defined policies, it is impossible to hold an organization's employees accountable, and difficult to respond to an incident without defined and practiced procedures such as a disaster recovery plan. The items below can help to define processes, policies, and procedures.

Proper policies and procedures for AD asset management.
AD host audit, the use of asset tags, and periodic asset inventories can help ensure hosts are not lost.
Access control policies (user account provisioning/de-provisioning), multi-factor authentication mechanisms.
Processes for provisioning and decommissioning hosts (i.e., baseline security hardening guideline, gold images)
AD cleanup policies
Are accounts for former employees removed or just disabled?
What is the process for removing stale records from AD?
Processes for decommissioning legacy operating systems/services (i.e., proper uninstallation of Exchange when migrating to 0365).
Schedule for User, groups, and hosts audit.
Technology
Periodically review AD for legacy misconfigurations and new and emerging threats. As changes are made to AD, ensure that common misconfigurations are not introduced. Pay attention to any vulnerabilities introduced by AD and tools or applications utilized in the environment.

Run tools such as BloodHound, PingCastle, and Grouper periodically to identify AD misconfigurations.
Ensure that administrators are not storing passwords in the AD account description field.
Review SYSVOL for scripts containing passwords and other sensitive data.
Avoid the use of "normal" service accounts, utilizing Group Managed (gMSA) and Managed Service Accounts (MSA) where ever possible to mitigate the risk of Kerberoasting.
Disable Unconstrained Delegation wherever possible.
Prevent direct access to Domain Controllers through the use of hardened jump hosts.
Consider setting the ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota attribute to 0, which disallows users from adding machine accounts and can prevent several attacks such as the noPac attack and Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)
Disable the print spooler service wherever possible to prevent several attacks
Disable NTLM authentication for Domain Controllers if possible
Use Extended Protection for Authentication along with enabling Require SSL only to allow HTTPS connections for the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services
Enable SMB signing and LDAP signing
Take steps to prevent enumeration with tools like BloodHound
Ideally, perform quarterly penetration tests/AD security assessments, but if budget constraints exist, these should be performed annually at the very least.
Test backups for validity and review/practice disaster recovery plans.
Enable the restriction of anonymous access and prevent null session enumeration by setting the RestrictNullSessAccess registry key to 1 to restrict null session access to unauthenticated users.
Protections By Section
As a different look at this, we have broken out the significant actions by section and correlated controls based on the TTP and a MITRE tag. Each tag corresponds with a section of the Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix found here. Any tag marked as TA corresponds to an overarching tactic, while a tag marked as T### is a technique found in the matrix under tactics.

TTP	MITRE Tag	Description
External Reconnaissance	T1589	This portion of an attack is extremely hard to detect and defend against. An attacker does not have to interact with your enterprise environment directly, so it's impossible to tell when it is happening. What can be done is to monitor and control the data you release publically to the world. Job postings, documents (and the metadata left attached), and other open information sources like BGP and DNS records all reveal something about your enterprise. Taking care to scrub documents before release can ensure an attacker cannot glean user naming context from them as an example. The same can be said for not providing detailed information about tools and equipment utilized in your networks via job postings.
Internal Reconnaissance	T1595	For reconnaissance of our internal networks, we have more options. This is often considered an active phase and, as such, will generate network traffic which we can monitor and place defenses based on what we see. Monitoring network traffic for any suspicious bursts of packets of a large volume from any one source or several sources can be indicative of scanning. A properly configured Firewall or Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) will spot these trends quickly and alert on the traffic. Depending on the tool or appliance, it may even be able to add a rule blocking traffic from said hosts proactively. The utilization of network monitoring coupled with a SIEM can be crucial to spotting reconnaissance. Properly tuning the Windows Firewall settings or your EDR of choice to not respond to ICMP traffic, among other types of traffic, can help deny an attacker any information they may glean from the results.
Poisoning	T1557	Utilizing security options like SMB message signing and encrypting traffic with a strong encryption mechanism will go a long way to stopping poisoning & man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing utilizes hashed authentication codes and verifies the identity of the sender and recipient of the packet. These actions will break relay attacks since the attacker is just spoofing traffic.
Password Spraying	T1110/003	This action is perhaps the easiest to defend against and detect. Simple logging and monitoring can tip you off to password spraying attacks in your network. Watching your logs for multiple attempts to login by watching Event IDs 4624 and 4648 for strings of invalid attempts can tip you off to password spraying or brute force attempts to access the host. Having strong password policies, an account lockout policy set, and utilizing two-factor or multi-factor authentication can all help prevent the success of a password spray attack. For a deeper look at the recommended policy settings, check out this article and the NIST documentation.
Credentialed Enumeration	TA0006	There is no real defense you can put in place to stop this method of attack. Once an attacker has valid credentials, they effectively can perform any action that the user is allowed to do. A vigilant defender can detect and put a stop to this, however. Monitoring for unusual activity such as issuing commands from the CLI when a user should not have a need to utilize it. Multiple RDP requests sent from host to host within the network or movement of files from various hosts can all help tip a defender off. If an attacker manages to acquire administrative privileges, this can become much more difficult, but there are network heuristics tools that can be put in place to analyze the network constantly for anomalous activity. Network segmentation can help a lot here.
LOTL	N/A	It can be hard to spot an attacker while they are utilizing the resources built-in to host operating systems. This is where having a baseline of network traffic and user behavior comes in handy. If your defenders understand what the day-to-day regular network activity looks like, you have a chance to spot the abnormal. Watching for command shells and utilizing a properly configured Applocker policy can help prevent the use of applications and tools users should not have access to or need.
Kerberoasting	T1558/003	Kerberoasting as an attack technique is widely documented, and there are plenty of ways to spot it and defend against it. The number one way to protect against Kerberoasting is to utilize a stronger encryption scheme than RC4 for Kerberos authentication mechanisms. Enforcing strong password policies can help prevent Kerberoasting attacks from being successful. Utilizing Group Managed service accounts is probably the best defense as this makes Kerberoasting no longer possible. Periodically auditing your users' account permissions for excessive group membership can be an effective way to spot issues.
MITRE ATT&CK Breakdown
text

I wanted to take a second to show everyone how it appears when exploring the ATT&CK framework. We will use the example above of Kerberoasting to look at it through the lens of the framework. Kerberoasting is a part of the larger Tactic tag TA0006 Credential Access (Green square in the image above). Tactics encompass the overall goal of the actor and will contain various techniques which map to that goal. Within this scope, you will see all manner of credential-stealing techniques. We can scroll down and look for Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets, which is Technique Tag T1558 (blue square in the image above). This technique contains four sub-techniques (indicated by the .00# beside the technique name) Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket, Kerberoasting, and AS-REP Roasting. Since we care about Kerberoasting, we would select the sub-technique T1558.003 (orange box in the image above), and it will take us to a new page. Here, we can see a general explanation of the technique, the information referencing the ATT&CK platform classification on the top right, examples of its use in the real world, ways to mitigate and detect the tactic, and finally, references for more information at the bottom of the page.

So our technique would be classified under TA0006/T1558.003. This is how the Tactic/Technique tree would be read. There are many different ways to navigate the framework. We just wanted to provide some clarification on what we were looking for and how we were defining tactics versus techniques when talking about MITRE ATT&CK in this module. This framework is great to explore if you are curious about a Tactic or Technique and want more information about it.

These are not an exhaustive list of defensive measures, but they are a strong start. As attackers, if we understand the potential defensive measures we can face during our assessments, we can plan for alternate means of exploitation and movement. We won't win every battle; some defenders may have their environments locked down tight and see every move you make, but others may have missed one of these recommendations. It is important to explore them all, and help provide the defensive team with the best results possible. Also, understanding how the attacks and defenses work will make us improve cybersecurity practitioners overall.

Print Spooler enabled on servers	Disable to prevent PrintNightmare and similar exploits
NTLM enabled	Disable if feasible; use Kerberos and modern authentication methods
MachineAccountQuota > 0	Set to 0 to prevent RBCD and noPac exploitation
No DR/BCP plan	Create and regularly test one
Weak passwords or reuse	Implement password filter + encourage enterprise password manager
🔁 Patterns & Hints for Reporting
Use MITRE ATT&CK tags to align each recommendation. It strengthens remediation justification.

e.g., Kerberoasting = TA0006 / T1558.003

Reference tooling regularly used by red teams (e.g., BloodHound) to justify the risk and provide defenders with actionable detection plans.

Recurring theme: AD issues aren’t usually a tech problem, they’re a people/process/config problem.

High ROI Remediations:

MachineAccountQuota = 0

Using gMSA instead of user accounts

Auditing DA group and login behavior

Reviewing SYSVOL and service descriptions for stored creds

🔗 Integration Tips (Obsidian/BloodHound Reporting)
Group recommendations into TTP blocks per engagement (e.g., T1558.003 → gMSA + AES + password policy).

Build a reusable table linking:

Finding → MITRE Technique → Exploit Used → Recommended Control.

Use this as a pre-filled remediation table in CPTS or real-world reports.

🧠 High-Level Summary: Active Directory Auditing
Purpose: Equip the client with evidence-based, actionable findings through rich tooling and visual reporting — not just for you as a pentester, but for them to secure budget, track misconfigs, and plan remediation.

Main Tools Covered:

AD Explorer (Snapshots)

PingCastle (Risk scoring + domain mapping)

Group3r (GPO enumeration and misconfig detection)

ADRecon (Full AD data dump for offline reporting)

Why It Matters: Hardening is one side of the coin — the other is visibility. These tools generate irrefutable artifacts that show where AD is weak and how to fix it.

🛠️ Workflow: AD Auditing for Evidence-Based Reporting

⚡️ If This, Then That (Reporting Angle)
If You Need	Then Use
Visual snapshot of AD state	AD Explorer
Maturity model scoring + domain misconfig graphs	PingCastle healthcheck
Find misconfigs in GPOs (e.g., startup scripts with creds)	Group3r
Comprehensive dump of AD objects, GPOs, trusts, users	ADRecon
Need visuals to support budget requests	PingCastle or AD Explorer diffs
Want to compare AD states pre/post assessment	AD Explorer snapshot comparison
Need CSVs for Excel dashboards or cross-tool import	ADRecon outputs
🔁 Patterns, Tips & Reporting Hints
🔎 Use Multiple Tools for Correlation:

Cross-reference PingCastle findings with Group3r or BloodHound.

If a user has dangerous GPO links and is also in DA, you’ve got strong evidence.

📊 Include Visuals in Final Report:

PingCastle visuals + AD Explorer object trees = exec-friendly reporting.

⚠️ Use Indentation & Hierarchy for Fast Parsing:

Especially in Group3r. Build a quick table in Obsidian for fast misconfig review.

💾 Export All Outputs:

Package all raw .log, .csv, and .html into your final reporting ZIP for the client.

🔗 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:

PingCastle and Group3r help surface techniques like T1558 (Kerberoasting), T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1069 (Permission Groups).

Map directly in findings for higher impact.

🧰 Quick Command Recap
bash

# Group3r Basic Usage
group3r.exe -f gpo_audit.log

# ADRecon
.\ADRecon.ps1
✅ Client-Facing Reporting Snippet (Template-Ready)
Finding: Excessive GPO permissions exposing startup script locations.

Tool: Group3r

Risk: Startup script contains plaintext credentials for shared service account. Mapped to T1059.001 (PowerShell) and T1078.002 (Valid Accounts - Domain).

Recommendation:

Remove the startup script or obfuscate secrets via secure vaults.

Migrate to Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA).

Review all GPOs containing Startup/Shutdown scripts for hardcoded secrets.

When you're ready, Buck, we can also build out your "Evidence Pack" report section template that combines these tools into a client-facing ZIP file with structure like:
