As we saw in the previous section, it is often possible to Kerberoast across a forest trust. If this is possible in the environment we are assessing, we can perform this with GetUserSPNs.py from our Linux attack host. To do this, we need credentials for a user that can authenticate into the other domain and specify the -target-domain flag in our command. Performing this against the FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL domain, we see one SPN entry for the mssqlsvc account.

Rerunning the command with the -request flag added gives us the TGS ticket. We could also add -outputfile <OUTPUT FILE> to output directly into a file that we could then turn around and run Hashcat against.

We could then attempt to crack this offline using Hashcat with mode 13100. If successful, we'd be able to authenticate into the FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL domain as a Domain Admin. If we are successful with this type of attack during a real-world assessment, it would also be worth checking to see if this account exists in our current domain and if it suffers from password re-use. This could be a quick win for us if we have not yet been able to escalate in our current domain. Even if we already have control over the current domain, it would be worth adding a finding to our report if we do find password re-use across similarly named accounts in different domains.

 Suppose we can Kerberoast across a trust and have run out of options in the current domain. In that case, it could also be worth attempting a single password spray with the cracked password, as there is a possibility that it could be used for other service accounts if the same admins are in charge of both domains. Here, we have yet another example of iterative testing and leaving no stone unturned.
Hunting Foreign Group Membership with Bloodhound-python
As noted in the last section, we may, from time to time, see users or admins from one domain as members of a group in another domain. Since only Domain Local Groups allow users from outside their forest, it is not uncommon to see a highly privileged user from Domain A as a member of the built-in administrators group in domain B when dealing with a bidirectional forest trust relationship. If we are testing from a Linux host, we can gather this information by using the Python implementation of BloodHound. We can use this tool to collect data from multiple domains, ingest it into the GUI tool and search for these relationships.

On some assessments, our client may provision a VM for us that gets an IP from DHCP and is configured to use the internal domain's DNS. We will be on an attack host without DNS configured in other instances. In this case, we would need to edit our resolv.conf file to run this tool since it requires a DNS hostname for the target Domain Controller instead of an IP address. We can edit the file as follows using sudo rights. Here we have commented out the current nameserver entries and added the domain name and the IP address of ACADEMY-EA-DC01 as the nameserver.

The bloodhound-python command will look similar to the previous one:

After uploading the second set of data (either each JSON file or as one zip file), we can click on Users with Foreign Domain Group Membership under the Analysis tab and select the source domain as INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. Here, we will see the built-in Administrator account for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain is a member of the built-in Administrators group in the FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL domain as we saw previously.

Viewing Dangerous Rights through BloodHound

Closing Thoughts on Trusts
As seen in the past few sections, there are several ways to leverage domain trusts to gain additional access and even do an "end-around" and escalate privileges in our current domain. For example, we can take over a domain that our current domain has a trust with, and find password re-use across privileged accounts. We've seen how Domain Admin rights in a child domain nearly always mean we can escalate privileges and compromise the parent domain using the ExtraSids attack. Domain trusts are a rather large and complex topic. The primer in this module has given us the tools to enumerate trusts and perform some standard intra-forest and cross-forest attacks.

GPT SUMMARY   
🧠 SUMMARY – Cross-Forest Trust Abuse (Linux Edition)
This section walks through Kerberoasting across a forest trust and enumerating foreign group memberships using Impacket tools and bloodhound-python from a Linux attack box. These attacks let you escalate from Domain A → Domain B across a bidirectional or inbound forest trust, often leading to full Domain Admin in another forest.

🛠️ WORKFLOW – Cross-Forest Kerberoasting + BloodHound Enumeration (Linux)
Phase 1 – Kerberoast Across Forest Trust
✅ Get valid credentials for a user in Domain A (your current domain)

🔁 Use GetUserSPNs.py to query for SPNs in Domain B:

bash
Copy
Edit
GetUserSPNs.py -target-domain <DomainB> <DomainA>/<User>
🔍 Look for high-privilege SPNs (e.g., in Domain Admins)

🎯 Re-run with -request to grab the TGS:

bash
Copy
Edit
GetUserSPNs.py -request -target-domain <DomainB> <DomainA>/<User>
🧠 Crack offline using hashcat -m 13100 — if cracked:

✅ You now have access to Domain B as a DA

Phase 2 – BloodHound Foreign Membership Hunting
⚙️ Edit /etc/resolv.conf to point to the DC of target domain for DNS resolution:

bash
Copy
Edit
domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
nameserver 172.16.5.238
🩸 Run bloodhound-python against each domain:

bash
Copy
Edit
bloodhound-python -d <DOMAIN> -dc <DC-HOSTNAME> -c All -u <user> -p <pass>
📦 Zip your JSON files and import into BloodHound GUI:

bash
Copy
Edit
zip -r domain_bloodhound.zip *.json
🔎 In BloodHound:

Go to Analysis > Users with Foreign Domain Group Membership

Find cross-domain Admin accounts or SID-based privileges

🔄 IF THIS, THEN THAT – Decision Tree
IF...	THEN...
You find SPNs in the trusted forest	Try Kerberoasting with GetUserSPNs.py
SPN belongs to a DA group	Crack that hash ASAP and log in
You crack the hash	Try reusing it in current forest too (pw reuse test)
SPN password doesn't crack	Consider password spray or move to foreign group checks
You upload BH data from both forests	Use BloodHound to ID cross-forest admin relationships
Admin from Domain A is in Domain B groups	Leverage that user to pivot & take over Domain B
📌 PATTERNS & HINTS
🔥 Kerberoasting Across Forests = Low-hanging fruit if bidirectional trust is in place.

🪪 Foreign Group Memberships show up often in shared-IT orgs or MSP-managed forests.

🔄 Password Reuse: Admins love keeping things "easy" across forests—always check!

💣 Only Domain Local Groups allow users from outside the forest — that’s your access vector.

🧵 Look for SIDs in ForeignSecurityPrincipals — that’s often a giveaway of cross-forest linkage.

🚨 Weak or no SID Filtering = Attack surface for SID History injection.

⚠️ CLOSING REAL-WORLD THOUGHTS
🔁 These are often pivot moves when you’re stuck in Domain A but need traction.

🪝 Use cross-forest attacks for lateral movement or vertical escalation when AD gets complicated.

📝 In reporting: if you find admin reuse, bad group memberships, or missing SID filtering — highlight it as a major architectural weakness.
