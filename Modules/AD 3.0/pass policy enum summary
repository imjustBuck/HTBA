✅ Summary: Password Policy Enumeration
🎯 Why It Matters:
Knowing password policy helps build realistic and targeted wordlists (e.g., complexity requirements, length).

Helps avoid account lockouts.

Helps estimate how frequently and how aggressively you can spray passwords.

🧭 Got This, Do That: Password Policy Enumeration
🔓 UNcredentialed Enumeration
🧪 Method 1: SMB NULL Session
Tools: rpcclient, enum4linux, enum4linux-ng, CrackMapExec

✅ Goal: Pull password policy anonymously via SMB

Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
rpcclient -U "" -N <DC_IP>
> querydominfo
> getdompwinfo
bash
Copy
Edit
enum4linux -P <DC_IP>
enum4linux-ng -P <DC_IP> -oA <output_base>
🧠 Look For:

Min password length

Complexity requirement

Lockout threshold + duration

🧪 Method 2: LDAP Anonymous Bind
Tools: ldapsearch, windapsearch.py, ad-ldapdomaindump.py

✅ Goal: Pull domain policies via LDAP with no auth

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
ldapsearch -h <DC_IP> -x -b "DC=domain,DC=local" -s sub "*" | grep -B10 pwdHistoryLength
🔐 Credentialed Enumeration
🧪 Method 1: CrackMapExec
bash
Copy
Edit
crackmapexec smb <DC_IP> -u <user> -p <pass> --pass-pol
🧪 Method 2: rpcclient (With Creds)
bash
Copy
Edit
rpcclient -U "<user>" -W "<domain>" <DC_IP>
> getdompwinfo
🧪 Method 3: Windows (Net.exe built-in)
cmd
Copy
Edit
net accounts
🧪 Method 4: PowerView
powershell
Copy
Edit
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
Get-DomainPolicy
🧠 What You Want to Extract:

Min/Max Password Length

Password Complexity (PasswordComplexity=1)

Lockout Threshold

Lockout Duration

Auto Unlock?

Password History

🧱 Default Password Policy Cheat Sheet
Policy	Default
Minimum password length	7
Maximum password age	42 days
Minimum password age	1 day
Password complexity required	Enabled
Lockout threshold	0
Lockout duration	Not set
Account unlock method	Usually auto
⚙️ When Stuck: Password Policy Enumeration Checklist
✅	Question	Tool
🔲	Do I have credentials?	CME, rpcclient, PowerView
🔲	Do NULL sessions work?	enum4linux, rpcclient
🔲	Does LDAP allow anonymous binds?	ldapsearch, windapsearch
🔲	Can I run net.exe on a Windows host?	net accounts
🔲	Can I import PowerView?	Get-DomainPolicy
🔲	Do I know the lockout threshold & duration?	All methods
🔲	Can I safely build a password list?	Based on policy
🧠 Key Insight for Spraying:
If you find:

✅ Min password length = 8

✅ Complexity = Enabled

✅ Lockout threshold = 5

✅ Lockout duration = 30 minutes

Then you can safely attempt 2-3 password guesses per user every 31 minutes.

But if you don’t know the policy:

Only 1 attempt per user.

Wait at least an hour between sprays.
