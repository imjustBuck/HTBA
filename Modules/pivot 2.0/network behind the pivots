🧠 Section Summary: The Networking Behind Pivoting
🔑 Goal of This Section
To pivot correctly, you must understand how networking works under the hood — especially:

Interfaces and IPs

Routing tables

Gateways

Ports & services

🧩 Got This, Do That — Networking Concepts for Pivoting
🎯 If you’ve compromised a host…
Got This	Do That
Host with multiple NICs	Run ifconfig (Linux/macOS) or ipconfig (Windows) — look for secondary IP ranges that indicate internal subnets you can pivot into
Host has public AND private IPs	Likely in a DMZ or dual-homed setup — private IPs might give you a way into internal LANs
NICs like tun0	This is your VPN interface (e.g., HTB labs). All traffic to the lab routes through this. Be aware of it when setting routes or forwarding
Host's NIC shows 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x	These are private subnets — confirm network segmentation and potential pivot candidates
You have shell on a box	Run route print or netstat -r (Windows), or ip route, netstat -rn (Linux) to check routing table and map reachable networks
Host can route to another subnet you can’t reach	Use tools like AutoRoute, pivot listeners, or SSH/Chisel to bounce traffic through it
🛠️ Tools / Commands to Know
Command	Use
ifconfig / ipconfig	Show all network interfaces, IPs, and NICs
ip route / netstat -r	Show the routing table — what networks the host can talk to
route add	Manually add a route (with or without AutoRoute in Meterpreter)
arp -a	Shows IP ↔ MAC mappings — helps identify other live hosts/subnets
tracert / traceroute	Confirm multi-hop routes and firewall traversal possibilities
🧭 Key Concepts Recap
✅ IP Addressing & NICs
Every NIC gets an IP — one host can have multiple NICs, each connected to a different subnet

Finding secondary NICs/IPs is the #1 way to find pivot opportunities

Look for internal IP ranges to find hidden networks (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, etc.)

✅ Routing
Routing table decides how traffic exits the box

Routes are:

Direct (host has an IP in the subnet)

Indirect (go to a gateway)

Learn the table → understand what subnets are reachable but isolated from you

Pivot hosts = become routers for you (via tools like autoroute, chisel, socat, etc.)

✅ Default Gateway
If traffic is going outside the local subnet, it's sent to the default gateway

You can piggyback this route if you pivot to a host on that LAN

✅ Protocols / Ports
Port = service endpoint, not a physical thing

Critical for pivoting because:

You’ll bind listeners on specific ports

You may need to spoof or forward traffic through allowed ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS)

Web servers, RDP, SMB = usually allowed in firewalls — use them as cover

🔥 Tactical Takeaways for CPTS + Real World
🧠 Always check for secondary NICs/IPs — pivot paths often hide here

🧭 Draw the network — use Draw.io or whiteboard to plan paths

🪞 Pivot = routing through compromised host — either with port forwarding or creating a new route

🕳️ Routing tables are gold — they reveal unseen subnets

⚙️ Be protocol-aware — know what’s allowed so you can “hide in plain sight”
