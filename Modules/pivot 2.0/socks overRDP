🔄 What is SocksOverRDP?
SocksOverRDP is a creative way to turn an RDP session itself into a tunnel using a SOCKS proxy over Windows' internal Dynamic Virtual Channels (DVC).
Basically, it piggybacks on your active RDP session to tunnel traffic, which is perfect when:

You can’t install SSH or Chisel.

You’re stuck in a Windows-only environment.

You're looking to fly under the radar with "built-in" behavior (clipboard, audio, etc.).

🧠 Flow Breakdown
Here’s how it plays out:

🔐 Setup Phase:
You RDP into a pivotable machine (like 172.16.5.19).

You copy over SocksOverRDP-Plugin.dll to your attack box (10.129.x.x), and then load it using:

cmd
Copy
Edit
regsvr32.exe SocksOverRDP-Plugin.dll
This acts as the client-side tunnel initializer over RDP.

You also need the server-side component (SocksOverRDP-Server.exe) to run on the internal machine (172.16.5.19).

🔌 Tunnel Initialization:
Once you connect to 172.16.5.19 using mstsc.exe, the SOCKS listener gets created on your initial machine (the one running the plugin DLL), and it will listen on:

makefile
Copy
Edit
127.0.0.1:1080
The server running on 172.16.5.19 (or wherever the RDP session terminates) will handle routing the traffic to your final destination, like:

Copy
Edit
172.16.6.155
🔄 Proxy Routing:
You fire up Proxifier Portable on your initial foothold machine (10.129.x.x) and configure it to send traffic through:

makefile
Copy
Edit
127.0.0.1:1080
Now any traffic (like mstsc.exe, PowerShell, or browser) goes:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Your foothold (10.129.x.x) → RDP tunnel → 172.16.5.19 → Internal target (172.16.6.155)
🔧 Realistic Use Cases:
✅ When SSH isn’t available (which happens often in Windows-heavy environments).
✅ When firewalls block traditional ports but RDP is open and already being used.
✅ When you want to avoid custom binaries or obvious tools that raise alarms.
✅ When detection evasion is critical, and you want to hide inside legit RDP traffic.

⚔️ Final Thoughts
Performance: It’s RDP — so it's slower than Chisel or SSH tunnels.

Stealth: Much stealthier in blue team environments.

Convenience: Not ideal for full exploitation, but killer for pivoting through internal Windows-only networks.
