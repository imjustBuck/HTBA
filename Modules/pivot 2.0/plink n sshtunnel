PLINK: 

🧠 What is Plink?
Plink.exe is the command-line version of PuTTY's SSH client.

Used on Windows systems to make SSH connections, just like ssh on Linux.

Supports dynamic port forwarding, meaning it can create a SOCKS proxy just like ssh -D.

🔧 Use Case in CPTS / Pentest Scenarios
You:

Compromise a Windows host that either:

Doesn’t have ssh installed (common pre-Win10 Fall 2018), or

Has PuTTY/Plink lying around

Need a pivot to another network or system

Don’t want to pull in too many tools that might trip AV/EDR

Boom—use Plink to build a SOCKS proxy and tunnel traffic through that box.

🧪 Command Breakdown
If you're on a Windows box, and want to create a SOCKS proxy via Plink:

bash
Copy
Edit
plink.exe -ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.15.50
-ssh → Protocol

-D 9050 → Start a SOCKS proxy on local port 9050

ubuntu@10.129.15.50 → Connect to the pivot box (Ubuntu)

🛠️ Optional Add-On: Proxifier
GUI tool for Windows to route traffic through SOCKS proxies.

Works like proxychains, but pretty.

Configure it to send traffic (like RDP, Nmap, or custom apps) through 127.0.0.1:9050.

🤔 So When Would You Use This?
You’re attacking from Windows (yes, it happens)

You compromised a Windows machine and need to pivot with what’s already there

SSH is still an option, but ssh.exe isn't available

You’re avoiding custom tools to keep OPSEC tight

🧩 Comparison to Others
Tool	Platform	Typical Usage
ssh -D	Linux/macOS	Default SOCKS tunneling on Linux-based attack box
Plink	Windows	SSH SOCKS tunneling when ssh is missing
proxychains	Linux	Routes tool traffic over a SOCKS/HTTP proxy
Proxifier	Windows	GUI version of proxychains
socat	Linux	Listener/redirector when SSH is not available



SSHTUNNEL: 

🚀 What Is sshuttle?
A Python-based tool that creates a transparent proxy over SSH.

It automates iptables rules to route traffic through a remote host without needing to manually set up proxychains or SOCKS proxies.

Think of it as "poor man's VPN" — once it's up, your whole system thinks it's on the pivot network.

🧰 When Would You Use It?
You’ve got SSH access to a pivot box (e.g., Ubuntu server).

You want to scan or interact with an internal network (e.g., 172.16.5.0/23) without setting up:

proxychains

socks_proxy

manual port forwarding

⚙️ How Does It Work?
You SSH into the pivot host with:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo sshuttle -r ubuntu@10.129.202.64 172.16.5.0/23 -v
-r: SSH into pivot box

172.16.5.0/23: internal subnet to route through that pivot

It:

Adds iptables NAT rules to reroute all traffic destined for that subnet

Routes that traffic transparently through SSH

No SOCKS proxy, no special configuration needed for tools

You then use any tool directly, e.g.:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -v -sV -p3389 172.16.5.19 -A -Pn
✅ Why Is It Nice?
Feature	sshuttle
Requires proxychains	❌ No
Requires SOCKS	❌ No
Transparent routing	✅ Yes
Works like VPN	✅ Yes
UDP support	❌ No
ICMP support	✅ Yes
Windows support	❌ Not native (Linux/macOS only)
🔐 OPSEC Thoughts
Pro: Very stealthy if you already have SSH access

Con: If your iptables changes get logged/monitored, it may raise flags on the pivot box

🔥 Real World or CPTS Use?
✅ Great for CPTS labs: fast setup, no proxychains jank, clean output

⚠️ Real world: works best when you’ve got legit SSH access (not always the case), and may not scale well compared to socks proxies and pivot tools
