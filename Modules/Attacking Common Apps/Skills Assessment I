During a penetration test against the company Inlanefreight, you have performed extensive enumeration and found the network to be quite locked down and well-hardened. You come across one host of particular interest that may be your ticket to an initial foothold. Enumerate the target host for potentially vulnerable applications, obtain a foothold, and submit the contents of the flag.txt file to complete this portion of the skills assessment.
