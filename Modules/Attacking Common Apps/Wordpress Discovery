Discovery/Footprinting
A quick way to identify a WordPress site is by browsing to the /robots.txt file. A typical robots.txt on a WordPress installation may look like: 

EXAMPLE: 
User-agent: *
Disallow: /wp-admin/
Allow: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
Disallow: /wp-content/uploads/wpforms/

Sitemap: https://inlanefreight.local/wp-sitemap.xml


Here the presence of the /wp-admin and /wp-content directories would be a dead giveaway that we are dealing with WordPress. Typically attempting to browse to the wp-admin directory will redirect us to the wp-login.php page. This is the login portal to the WordPress instance's back-end.

there are curl + grep commands we can run to garner further information BUT we can also just use the automated tool of WPscan -> 

SYNTAX 2 DOWNLAOD: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo gem install wpscan 

WPScan is also able to pull in vulnerability information from external sources. We can obtain an API token from WPVulnDB, which is used by WPScan to scan for PoC and reports. The free plan allows up to 75 requests per day. To use the WPVulnDB database, just create an account and copy the API token from the users page. This token can then be supplied to wpscan using the --api-token parameter.

ENUMERATION EXAMPLE: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo wpscan --url http://blog.inlanefreight.local --enumerate --api-token dEOFB<SNIP>

<SNIP>
