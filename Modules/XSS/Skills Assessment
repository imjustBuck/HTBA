We are performing a Web Application Penetration Testing task for a company that hired you, which just released their new Security Blog. In our Web Application Penetration Testing plan, we reached the part where you must test the web application against Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities (XSS).

Apply the skills you learned in this module to achieve the following:

1. Identify a user-input field that is vulnerable to an XSS vulnerability
2. Find a working XSS payload that executes JavaScript code on the target's browser
3. Using the Session Hijacking techniques, try to steal the victim's cookies, which should contain the flag



Question 1 -  What is the value of the 'flag' cookie?
