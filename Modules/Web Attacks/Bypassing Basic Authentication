so we are met with a login page of which we do not have the creds for... so we are going to try Bypass techniques inside of burp and change the request type.. 

83.136.251.75:37643

so were going to want to open burp

navigate to web page and we see the reset button 

hit the reset button and intercept it with burp -> go to burp proxy and find: 

GET /admin/reset.php? HTTP/1.1

What we are going to do inside the PROXY is change 1 word in 1 line: 

GET /admin/reset.php? HTTP/1.1
  CHANGE TO: 
OPTIONS or PATH /admin/reset.php? HTTP/1.1


hit forward inside of burp proxy, then revist the site as the orginal url of -> http://83.136.251.75:37643 and we see waiting for us on the home page the flag of
