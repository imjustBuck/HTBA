 Other than GET and POST, the following are some of the commonly used HTTP verbs:

Verb	                        Description
HEAD	                        Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the headers, without the response body
PUT	                          Writes the request payload to the specified location
DELETE	                      Deletes the resource at the specified location
OPTIONS	                      Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs
PATCH	                        Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location
