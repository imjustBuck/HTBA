Web crawling is vast and intricate, but you don't have to embark on this journey alone. A plethora of web crawling tools are available to assist you, each with its own strengths and specialties. These tools automate the crawling process, making it faster and more efficient, allowing you to focus on analyzing the extracted data.

Popular Web Crawlers
1. Burp Suite Spider: Burp Suite, a widely used web application testing platform, includes a powerful active crawler called Spider. Spider excels at mapping out web applications, identifying hidden content, and uncovering potential vulnerabilities.

2. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): ZAP is a free, open-source web application security scanner. It can be used in automated and manual modes and includes a spider component to crawl web applications and identify potential vulnerabilities.

3. Scrapy (Python Framework): Scrapy is a versatile and scalable Python framework for building custom web crawlers. It provides rich features for extracting structured data from websites, handling complex crawling scenarios, and automating data processing. Its flexibility makes it ideal for tailored reconnaissance tasks.

4. Apache Nutch (Scalable Crawler): Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open-source web crawler written in Java. It's designed to handle massive crawls across the entire web or focus on specific domains. While it requires more technical expertise to set up and configure, its power and flexibility make it a valuable asset for large-scale reconnaissance projects.

Adhering to ethical and responsible crawling practices is crucial no matter which tool you choose. Always obtain permission before crawling a website, especially if you plan to perform extensive or intrusive scans. Be mindful of the website's server resources and avoid overloading them with excessive requests.

Scrapy
We will leverage Scrapy and a custom spider tailored for reconnaissance on inlanefreight.com. If you are interested in more information on crawling/spidering techniques, refer to the "Using Web Proxies" module, as it forms part of CBBH as well.

Installing Scrapy
Before we begin, ensure you have Scrapy installed on your system. If you don't, you can easily install it using pip, the Python package installer:

INSTALL EXAMPLE: 
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install scrapy

ReconSpider
First, run this command in your terminal to download the custom scrapy spider, ReconSpider, and extract it to the current working directory.

INSTALL SYNTAX: 
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ wget -O ReconSpider.zip https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/144/ReconSpider.v1.2.zip
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ unzip ReconSpider.zip 

With the files extracted, you can run ReconSpider.py using the following command:

SYNTAX: 
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ python3 ReconSpider.py http://inlanefreight.com
Replace inlanefreight.com with the domain you want to spider. The spider will crawl the target and collect valuable information.

results.json
After running ReconSpider.py, the data will be saved in a JSON file, results.json. This file can be explored using any text editor. Below is the structure of the JSON file produced:

EXAMPLE: 
{
    "emails": [
        "lily.floid@inlanefreight.com",
        "cvs@inlanefreight.com",
        ...
    ],
    "links": [
        "https://www.themeansar.com",
        "https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/offices/",

        ...
    ]
}
