🔍 SUMMARY: Thick Client Assessment (HTB Module)
What It Is:

Apps installed locally (not browser-based), often custom-built for orgs.

Common in enterprise environments for project tracking, inventory, support, etc.

Built with languages like .NET, Java, C++, Silverlight.

Key Attack Vectors:

Local storage of creds/configs

Hardcoded passwords, poor error handling

Reverse engineering / static analysis

Memory inspection / dynamic analysis

DLL hijacking / binary abuse

Network sniffing for sensitive traffic

Server-side OWASP-type flaws (SQLi, etc.)

Architecture Types:

2-tier: App ↔ DB directly

3-tier: App ↔ App Server ↔ DB (more secure)

# Step-by-Step Engagement

1. **Initial Recon**
   - Identify architecture (2-tier vs 3-tier)
   - Note file types: `.exe`, `.jar`, `.dll`, etc.
   - Use tools like CFF Explorer, Detect It Easy, Strings

2. **Static Analysis**
   - Reverse app: DnSpy (for .NET), JADX (for Java), Ghidra/IDA
   - Look for hardcoded creds, file paths, debug info
   - Decompile any embedded binaries if found

3. **Dynamic Analysis**
   - Monitor behavior using ProcMon, TCPView, x64dbg
   - Watch for spawned processes, dropped files
   - Use memory tools to dump in-memory .NET assemblies

4. **Network Monitoring**
   - Wireshark / Burp to capture traffic (esp. if HTTP-based)
   - Look for plaintext creds, API calls, SOAP/REST interactions

5. **Payload Triggering**
   - If you find base64 blobs or PowerShell scripts, decode + run
   - Watch for dropped binaries (like restart-service.exe in this case)

6. **Credential Looting**
   - If you hit something like runas.exe with creds, try lateral movement
   - Look for AD commands, service restarts, local admin creds

IF app drops temp files
→ Monitor Temp dir with ProcMon
→ Disable delete perms → rerun binary
→ Inspect dropped scripts (batch/ps1)

IF batch/ps1 drops base64 content
→ Extract + decode manually (manual reassemble)
→ Analyze resulting executable (likely .NET)

IF memory map shows MZ headers
→ Dump memory from x64dbg
→ Use Strings to confirm .NET signature
→ Reverse using DnSpy + De4Dot

IF .NET binary runs with hardcoded creds
→ Check for service control or AD interaction
→ Use creds for lateral movement (psexec, wmiexec, etc.)

IF thick client communicates over network
→ Sniff with Wireshark or Burp Suite
→ Look for sensitive tokens, usernames, or auth headers
🧠 HINTS & PATTERNS (REAL-WORLD / EXAM USE)
ProcMon + x64dbg combo is killer: Always use ProcMon to find where stuff’s dropped, then x64dbg to see what’s loaded into memory.

Memory dump ≠ useless blob: If you see MZ or .NETFramework in strings, you’re sitting on a reverse-engineering goldmine.

Find PowerShell chains: Encoded PS in bat files is often used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

Static + Dynamic > One or the other: Reverse the binary AND monitor its runtime — lots of thick client magic is runtime-dependent.

Look for RunAs logic: Hardcoded credentials are often embedded in thick clients that perform actions on behalf of users.

x64dbg settings: Turn off all breakpoints except exit — avoids wasting time in DLL hell during load.

🎯 CPTS CONTEXT: When to Consider a Thick Client Attack Path
🔥 WHEN DOES THIS POP UP?
Scenario	You Might Be Looking At a Thick Client
You compromise a host and see custom .exe apps sitting in C:\Apps\, Desktop, Downloads, etc.	👀 Reverse engineer it — could be a thick client
You loot SMB shares like NETLOGON, SYSVOL, shared folders and find executables, DLLs, bat/ps1 scripts	🧠 Flag for analysis — may drop or reconstruct binaries
You're watching a process in ProcMon or tasklist that spawns other files (especially .bat, .ps1, or .tmp) in AppData\Temp	🎯 That's the thick client unpacking a payload or config
You’re stuck on a low-priv user and find in-house tools with names like Reset-Password.exe, Restart-Service.exe, etc.	🔑 These often include hardcoded creds or invoke privileged operations
🧠 WHAT SHOULD YOU THINK/DO WHEN YOU SEE THAT?
Think: "If it’s homegrown and runs stuff… I’m opening it up."

✅ Your CPTS Brain Should Say:
"What’s in this .exe?"

Use strings, DetectItEasy, or dnSpy if .NET.

Reverse it if needed (use Ghidra, x64dbg).

"Is this creating files I can steal?"

Monitor AppData\Local\Temp while running it.

Use ProcMon64 to track file I/O.

"Is this hiding creds or spawning tools?"

Look for dropped *.bat, *.ps1, or base64 blobs.

Manually decode & run extracted scripts or binaries.

🧩 WHEN TO JUMP INTO THIS DURING CPTS
Phase	Trigger	Action
Post-Initial Foothold	You land on a box and loot an SMB share or C:\ directory	Look for custom tools/exes/scripts — thick client path
Privilege Escalation	You’re low-priv, can’t find typical Windows escalation	See if any .exe lets you interact with services / creds
Lateral Movement	You find an executable that interacts with services or DBs	Dump its memory / reverse it to extract hardcoded passwords
You're stuck and need creds	Nothing in memory, no hashes, no dumpable LSASS	This thick client stuff might hand you passwords on a silver platter
🧭 CPTS-STYLE FLOWCHART (IF THIS, THEN THAT)

IF you find a suspicious executable in SMB or on disk
→ Run it with ProcMon active to see temp file drops
→ Disable delete perms on Temp
→ Capture .bat or .ps1 output (especially if base64)

IF the binary is .NET (or shows signs of MZ + Framework in strings)
→ Open in DnSpy
→ Look for hardcoded usernames, passwords, service logic

IF you extract a new binary from memory or decoding
→ Run that with ProcMon or x64dbg
→ Look for what registry keys or services it touches
→ Use creds to escalate or move laterally

IF you’re stuck on a box with no path forward
→ Re-check for any strange .exe or in-house tools
→ They’re probably hiding secrets in plain sight
🔐 CPTS Exam Tip:
🧠 Thick client paths won’t be obvious. If you’re on a box and:

you can’t dump LSASS,

can’t abuse services,

can’t privesc via usual weak perms,

Pause, list all .exe files you didn’t investigate yet.

These might be the key to dumping creds, building new binaries, or pivoting to another host.
