🧠 Summary: Attacking Applications Connecting to Services
You’re dealing with apps that connect to services like:

MS SQL

LDAP

SMB

APIs …and they often store hardcoded credentials or connection strings in compiled binaries (like .exe, .dll, or .jar).

Your job is to reverse the logic or string references, extract creds, then reuse them to pop other boxes or move laterally.

⚙️ Workflow
🐧 ELF Binary (Linux)
🕵️ Run it locally to observe behavior.

🧠 Use gdb or gdb-peda to:

disas main

Find SQLDriverConnect or similar functions.

Look for mov rdx, "some string" → follow that memory address.

🎯 Set breakpoints right before the connection call.

💥 Dump RDX (or whatever holds the connection string):

ini
Copy
Edit
DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17};SERVER=localhost,1401;UID=user;PWD=pass;
🪟 DLL Files (.NET)
📥 Grab the .dll via SMB, FTP, or whatever.

🔍 Open it with dnSpy.

🔓 Browse to Controllers, Models, or Startup methods.

🎯 Look for:

SQL connection strings

API tokens

Internal URIs (http://localhost:8081, jwt=eyJ...)

📌 Copy out secrets and test them on:

MSSQL: sqsh, impacket-mssqlclient, or sqlcmd

Web login pages

Internal services

Password spraying tools like kerbrute, hydra, or crackmapexec

🧩 If This, Then That (ITTT)
If You Find...	Then Do...
SQL connection string in .exe or .dll	Try to connect to the DB directly with mssqlclient.py
HTTP URLs in strings (like localhost:8081)	Try SSRF, internal API hits, or curl inside the box
.Net DLL and it's readable in dnSpy	Look for config loading code or controllers for secrets
Passwords or usernames embedded	Try them for local priv esc, RDP, SQL access, SMB shares
SQLDriverConnect or connection function in GDB	Break on it and dump the register (usually RDX)
💡 Patterns & Hints
Binaries for internal services often store plaintext creds.

Look for anything .config, .dll, .jar, or .ini in:

C:\Users\*\AppData

/opt/, /var/www/, /etc/, or custom dev folders.

.NET apps are a goldmine—dnSpy turns them into C# like magic.

This is post-foothold enumeration—after popping the box, start poking the local apps.

🧠 Pro Tip
If you’re in an exam or assessment:

Always inspect local binaries or web apps running on uncommon ports (8081, 5000, etc.)

Most people overlook the fact that local apps often hold cleartext creds or API secrets.

Those creds might reuse passwords for SQL, SMB, RDP, or AD logins — jackpot 🎰
