🧠 “Got This → Do That” – osTicket Edition
✅ Got This: Port 80/443, generic Apache/IIS + EyeWitness shows osTicket branding
Do This:

Look for:

powered by osTicket

Cookie named OSTSESSID

Browse to:

/scp/login.php → Admin/staff login

/open.php → User-side ticket creation

✅ Got This: Can submit ticket at /open.php
Do This:

Submit ticket with external email (your own or fake)

You may receive a custom support email like:
940288@inlanefreight.local

Use this email to register on:

GitLab, Slack, Rocket.Chat, Mattermost, Wiki, etc.

Receive verification through osTicket interface

📌 This turns osTicket into a “Company Email Generator” — you now have a backdoor for account registration on internal tools

✅ Got This: Support portal accessible & email assigned
Do This:

Submit ticket

Monitor for agent replies

Extract:

Names

Email patterns

Internal comms

“Standard password” mentions 👀

✅ Got This: Found leaked creds (e.g. via Dehashed, old dump)
Do This:

Try username and email in login:

sql
Copy
Edit
jclayton / JulieC8765!
kevin / Fish1ng_s3ason!
kevin@inlanefreight.local / Fish1ng_s3ason!
Successful login? You’re in the staff console: /scp/login.php
→ Browse open/closed tickets

✅ Got This: You’re inside a support agent’s view
Do This:

Look for:

VPN/reset discussions

“New joiner” passwords

Common patterns (e.g. Welcome123!, Spring2024!)

Sensitive files or data attachments

Export address book if accessible → useful for spraying

✅ Got This: Found “standard reset password” in support ticket
Do This:

Try login on exposed services:

vpn.inlanefreight.local

RDP, OWA, Citrix, anything else in subdomain list

Try password spraying using common names + the “reset password”

🧠 Bonus Move:
Use tools like:

linkedin2username to create a user list

Sprayhound or crackmapexec to password spray

Use harvested company emails to impersonate internally or for further recon

🏁 Closing Thoughts (Real-World Impact)
Support portals are high-value even without direct RCE:

They leak emails, tickets, user behavior, and internal language

One “Oops” by helpdesk giving out a password = VPN access = Foothold

osTicket is your internal social engineering playground
