üß† Summary: ColdFusion in CPTS Terms
You‚Äôre likely to encounter this on web-facing Windows targets, often tied to ColdFusion 8-11.

It‚Äôs old and dusty, but if you see port 8500 open, or directories like /CFIDE or .cfm extensions, you might have a juicy RCE or LFI.

This is post-scan/post-enum, not a first-hit vector unless you immediately see ColdFusion signs in Nmap or HTTP responses.

‚öîÔ∏è CPTS Workflow: ColdFusion Enumeration & Exploitation
‚úÖ Discovery
Nmap: Port 8500 open ‚Üí suspicious.

Check HTTP paths:

/CFIDE/administrator/

/cfdocs/

Look for .cfm, .cfc extensions

‚úÖ Vulnerability Identification
Run searchsploit adobe coldfusion

Match ColdFusion version (e.g., v8) to:

CVE-2010-2861: Directory Traversal ‚Üí password.properties loot

CVE-2009-2265: Unauth RCE via FCKeditor upload

‚úÖ Exploitation
Directory Traversal

Use: /CFIDE/administrator/settings/mappings.cfm?locale=../../../../etc/passwd

Or run Python exploit 14641.py with:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python2 14641.py <ip> 8500 "../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties"
Unauthenticated RCE

Upload payload via vulnerable endpoint:

swift
Copy
Edit
/CFIDE/scripts/ajax/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/cfm/upload.cfm
Run 50057.py with proper lhost, rhost, lport

üîÅ If This, Then That (ITTT)
Got This	Do That
Port 8500 open	Check /CFIDE/administrator/ path
.cfm files or ColdFusion headers	Identify version (ColdFusion 8, 9, 11 etc.)
Can access /CFIDE/...	Try LFI with locale=../../... (CVE-2010-2861)
Version = ColdFusion 8	Try RCE exploit 50057.py for unauthenticated file upload
Got password.properties	Look for credentials or decrypt hashes for lateral move
Nothing juicy via traversal	Try uploading and triggering .jsp webshell
.cfm errors show up	Check if query strings allow command injection (cfexecute abuse)
üß© Hints & Patterns
CFIDE folder is like the ‚Äúadmin panel‚Äù dead giveaway.

ColdFusion loves verbose error messages ‚Äî input random junk to get error-based versioning.

If your .jsp shell path ends in .jsp/yourfile.txt in response ‚Üí backtrack and test just .jsp.

Payload naming is often UUID-style ‚Äî watch for the response from 50057.py to copy the right shell path.

üí≠ Real Talk (CPTS Mental Model)
You‚Äôre not expected to memorize the exact exploits.

You're expected to recognize the tech, identify vuln fingerprints, and execute known exploitation paths efficiently.

ColdFusion = legacy tech with legacy flaws. If you spot it, 99% chance you can pop it.
