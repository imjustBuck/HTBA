ðŸ”„ Summary: What This Section Actually Says
Real-life networks are messy.

You wonâ€™t always see the exact 9 apps from the modules.

But if you know how to fingerprint, enumerate, and exploit apps? Youâ€™re fine.

Your scans will be noisy.

EyeWitness reports might be 500+ pages deep.

The gold (like forgotten Jenkins boxes or default creds on Axis2) is there if you keep digging.

Think modular, not memorized.

Did you learn how to:

Spot login portals?

Try default creds?

Recognize Git repos with secrets?

Abuse APIs like Zabbix?

Throw a .war or .aar for RCE?

Then youâ€™ve got what you need.

ðŸ”¥ Honorable Mentions â€“ What to Actually Do When You See These:
App	What To Do
Axis2	Check for admin:axis2. If in, upload AAR (Axis2 service webshell) or use Metasploit.
WebSphere	Try system:manager, deploy .war shell, get RCE.
Elasticsearch	Check for old unauthenticated APIs, maybe /_search or file disclosure.
Zabbix	Abuse API â†’ execute remote commands. CVEs and built-in features both dangerous.
Nagios	Try nagiosadmin:PASSW0RD, fingerprint version, look for RCE or privesc.
WebLogic	Check for Java deserialization RCEs (lots of unauth RCEs over the years).
Internal Wikis / SharePoint	Search for credentials, SSH keys, secrets, etc.
DotNetNuke (DNN)	Look for file upload, auth bypass, XSS. Itâ€™s a classic .NET mess.
vCenter	Try CVE-2021-22005 (OVA upload RCE), weak creds, or privesc (JuicyPotato if Windows).
ðŸ§  TL;DR Mental Model
Find a weird web app? â†’ Fingerprint it.
Find login panel? â†’ Try default creds.
Get a version number? â†’ Google public exploits.
Nothing works? â†’ Look for built-in features you can abuse.
