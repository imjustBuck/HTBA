🧠 Summary — What’s This?
IIS Tilde Enumeration is used to find:

Hidden directories/files

Short 8.3 filenames (e.g., SECRET~1, UPLOAD~1, etc.)

Only applies to IIS (especially v6/7.5) on Windows file systems

This works because Windows still generates legacy 8.3 names even if you don’t see them in the UI — and IIS sometimes leaks info about them when you request /~X.

🛠️ Workflow — Got This? Do That
🪜 Step-by-Step:
Identify IIS running (e.g., IIS/7.5 seen via Nmap)

Run iis_shortname_scanner.jar:

Usage: java -jar iis_shortname_scanner.jar 0 5 http://target/

Tells you if it's vulnerable, and reveals:

Short directories (e.g., UPLOAD~1)

Short filenames (e.g., TRANSF~1.ASP)

Try accessing the resources directly:

http://target/UPLOAD~1/

http://target/UPLOAD~1/TRANSF~1.ASP

If blocked or incomplete:

Craft custom wordlist based on pattern (e.g., starts with transf)

Use gobuster to brute-force the full name:

bash
Copy
Edit
gobuster dir -u http://target/ -w list.txt -x .asp,.aspx
🔄 ITTT — If This, Then That
Situation	Action
IIS detected + version ≤ 7.5	Run iis_shortname_scanner.jar
Short name like TRANSF~1.ASP found	Try GET request directly
403 / 404 / no luck	Craft list of likely file prefixes → use gobuster
Gobuster finds transferdata.aspx or similar	That’s your foothold → check for upload, auth bypass, etc.
App uses .NET backend	Add .aspx and .cs to wordlist brute-force
🧩 Patterns and Hints
Short name format:

UPLOAD~1, ADMINP~1, INDEX~1.ASP

If iis_shortname_scanner says "vulnerable", it will leak shortnames, even if GETs are blocked

Useful when robots.txt, auth walls, or hidden folders are present

Gobuster + partial knowledge = full path reveal

💥 When Does This Pop in CPTS?
Typically early game on web targets (recon > foothold)

Might be a web server that has no visible content, but you sniff out a .NET app using iis_shortname_scanner

Could lead to a file upload endpoint or RCE via upload.aspx or transfer.aspx

🧠 TL;DR - CPTS Mindset
"No files in sight? IIS smells funny? Tilde scan that thing."

This is one of those obscure recon techniques that can blow a web target wide open — not super common, but dangerous when it works. Keep it in your bag.
