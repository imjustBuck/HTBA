######## Enumeration Principles 

OSINT is an independent procedure and should be performed separately from enumeration because OSINT is based exclusively on passive information gathering and does not involve active enumeration of the given target.

Enumeration is a loop in which we repeatedly gather information based on what data we have or have already discovered.

Once we have identified targets in our client's infrastructure, we need to examine the individual services and protocols. 
In most cases, these are services that enable communication between customers, the infrastructure, the administration, and the employees.

!*!*!*!**!*! Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there. !*!*!*!*!*!*!*

We wouldnt start hunting for treasure by just picking a shovel up and digging in a random spot, we would prepare for it. Gather materials, read maps, pack gear, learn the terrain. map it out and carefully plan out the "hunt" 

Things to think about beyond the actual information provided or gathered: 

What can we see?
What reasons can we have for seeing it?
What image does what we see create for us?
What do we gain from it?
How can we use it?
What can we not see?
What reasons can there be that we do not see?
What image results for us from what we do not see?

An important aspect that must not be confused here is that there are always exceptions to the rules. The principles, however, do not change. 
Another advantage of these principles is that we can see from the practical tasks that we do not lack penetration testing abilities but technical understanding when we suddenly do not know how to proceed because our core task is not to exploit the machines but to find how they can be exploited.

Principles: 

No.	Principle
1.	There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.
2.	Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.
3.	There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.


######### Enumeration Methodology 


Layer	                              Description	                                                                                               Information Categories
1. Internet Presence	              Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.	                             Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures
2. Gateway	                        Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure.	   Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare
3. Accessible Services	            Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.	                     Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface
4. Processes	                      Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.	                 PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination
5. Privileges	                      Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.	                     Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment
6. OS Setup	                        Identification of the internal components and systems setup.	                                             OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files


Important note: The human aspect and the information that can be obtained by employees using OSINT have been removed from the "Internet Presence" layer for simplicity.


Layer No.1: Internet Presence
The first layer we have to pass is the "Internet Presence" layer, where we focus on finding the targets we can investigate. If the scope in the contract allows us to look for additional hosts, this layer is even more critical than for fixed targets only. 
In this layer, we use different techniques to find domains, subdomains, netblocks, and many other components and information that present the presence of the company and its infrastructure on the Internet.

**********The goal of this layer is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces that can be tested.**********

Layer No.2: Gateway
Here we try to understand the interface of the reachable target, how it is protected, and where it is located in the network. Due to the diversity, different functionalities, and some particular procedures, we will go into more detail about this layer in other modules.

*******************The goal is to understand what we are dealing with and what we have to watch out for.

Layer No.3: Accessible Services
In the case of accessible services, we examine each destination for all the services it offers. Each of these services has a specific purpose that has been installed for a particular reason by the administrator. 
Each service has certain functions, which therefore also lead to specific results. To work effectively with them, we need to know how they work. Otherwise, we need to learn to understand them.

************This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it for our purposes effectively.

This is the part of enumeration we will mainly deal with in this module.

Layer No.4: Processes
Every time a command or function is executed, data is processed, whether entered by the user or generated by the system. This starts a process that has to perform specific tasks, and such tasks have at least one source and one target.

********************The goal here is to understand these factors and identify the dependencies between them.

Layer No.5: Privileges
Each service runs through a specific user in a particular group with permissions and privileges defined by the administrator or the system. These privileges often provide us with functions that administrators overlook. This often happens in Active Directory infrastructures and many other case-specific administration environments and servers where users are responsible for multiple administration areas.

****************It is crucial to identify these and understand what is and is not possible with these privileges.

Layer No.6: OS Setup
Here we collect information about the actual operating system and its setup using internal access. This gives us a good overview of the internal security of the systems and reflects the skills and capabilities of the company's administrative teams.

*************The goal here is to see how the administrators manage the systems and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them.


### DOMAIN INFORMATION 

This type of information is gathered passively without direct and active scans. 
In other words, we remain hidden and navigate as "customers" or "visitors" to avoid direct connections to the company that could expose us. 

when passively gathering information, we can use third-party services to understand the company better. 
However, the first thing we should do is scrutinize the company's main website. Then, we should read through the texts, keeping in mind what technologies and structures are needed for these services..

Things beyond jsut hte main site we can research:

Certificates 
DNS records 

Cert Syntax: 

MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=<URL>\&output\=json | jq .


Sorting Syntax: 

MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u


Once we see which hosts can be investigated further, we can generate a list of IP addresses with a minor adjustment to the cut command and run them through Shodan.

Shodan can be used to find devices and systems permanently connected to the Internet like Internet of Things (IoT). 
It searches the Internet for open TCP/IP ports and filters the systems according to specific terms and criteria. 
For example, open HTTP or HTTPS ports and other server ports for FTP, SSH, SNMP, Telnet, RTSP, or SIP are searched. 
As a result, we can find devices and systems, such as surveillance cameras, servers, smart home systems, industrial controllers, traffic lights and traffic controllers, and various network components.


SHODAN IP SYNTAX

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
        MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done



### DNS RECORDS 

Syntax - MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ dig any url.com -> we can change out any for literally "any" of the DNS record types -> MX / A / AAAA / CAA 


####### HOST BASED ENUMERATION ########## 

### FTP 

File transfer protocol is one of hte oldest protocols and its jsut that. a protocol to transfer files.  it runs on the application layer of TCP/IP stack. so same layer as HTTP or P0P

## TFTP 
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it does not provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. 
In addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses UDP, making it an unreliable protocol and causing it to use UDP-assisted application layer recovery.

Commands	                        Description
connect	                                Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.
get	                                Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.
put	                                Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.
quit	                                Exits tftp.
status	                                Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on.
verbose	                                Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.

Unlike the FTP client, TFTP does not have directory listing functionality.

i will mostly be focusing on FTP for now since ive maybe used VsFTP once or twice over three years.. if more is needed on that topic i will modify these notes. 

## Dangerous Settings

Downloading files from such an FTP server is one of the main features, as well as uploading files created by us. 
This allows us, for example, to use LFI vulnerabilities to make the host execute system commands. Apart from the files, we can view, download and inspect.
Attacks are also possible with the FTP logs, leading to Remote Command Execution (RCE). 
This applies to the FTP services and all those we can detect during our enumeration phase.

The default script scan is based on the services' fingerprints, responses, and standard ports. 
Once Nmap has detected the service, it executes the marked scripts one after the other, providing different information. 
For example, the ftp-anon NSE script checks whether the FTP server allows anonymous access. 
If so, the contents of the FTP root directory are rendered for the anonymous user.

The ftp-syst, for example, executes the STAT command, which displays information about the FTP server status. 
This includes configurations as well as the version of the FTP server.
Nmap also provides the ability to trace the progress of NSE scripts at the network level if we use the --script-trace option in our scans. 
This lets us see what commands Nmap sends, what ports are used, and what responses we receive from the scanned server.

The scan history shows that four different parallel scans are running against the service, with various timeouts. 
For the NSE scripts, we see that our local machine uses other output ports (54226, 54228, 54230, 54232) and first initiates the connection with the CONNECT command.
From the first response from the server, we can see that we are receiving the banner from the server to our second NSE script (54228) from the target FTP server. 
If necessary, we can, of course, use other applications such as netcat or telnet to interact with the FTP server.

Service Interaction
  FTP
Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
  FTP
Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.136 21

It looks slightly different if the FTP server runs with TLS/SSL encryption. Because then we need a client that can handle TLS/SSL. For this, we can use the client openssl and communicate with the FTP server. 
The good thing about using openssl is that we can see the SSL certificate, which can also be helpful.


#### FTP CHALLENGE 

Question 1 - Which version of the FTP server is running on the target system? Submit the entire banner as the answer. - for this ill do my go to nmap scan and we can just do - nmap -p21 -sCV -A <ip> - InFreight FTP v1.1

!!! logging into the ftp server after running the nmap scan above allowed me to knwo anonymous login was allowed and it told me the version as soon as i typed in ' ftp 10.129.203.220 ' and then i did use the get command to get flag.txt and get the answer 

Question 2 - Enumerate the FTP server and find the flag.txt file. Submit the contents of it as the answer. -> before trying im assuming im going to connect to ftp via anonymous then use the get command on flag.txt and then read it off host machine -> HTB{b7skjr4c76zhsds7fzhd4k3ujg7nhdjre}


## SMB FOOTPRINTING!!! 

After my first time through i know SMB comes up a lot in the AD portion of the learning path. 

SMB is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network. 

In IP networks, SMB uses TCP protocol for this purpose, which provides for a three-way handshake between client and server before a connection is finally established. 
The specifications of the TCP protocol also govern the subsequent transport of data. ## so connections / authentications play a big role im what wwe can get out of SMB Sahres 

An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. 
Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. 
Access rights are defined by Access Control Lists (ACL). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as execute, read, and full access for individual users or user groups. 
The ACLs are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.


We see global settings and two shares that are intended for printers. 
The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares. 
In the individual shares, however, the global settings can be overwritten, which can be configured with high probability even incorrectly. 
Let us look at some of the settings to understand how the shares are configured in Samba.

Setting	                                                Description
[sharename]	                                        The name of the network share.
workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN	                        Workgroup that will appear when clients query.
path = /path/here/	                                The directory to which user is to be given access.
server string = STRING	                                The string that will show up when a connection is initiated.
unix password sync = yes	                        Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password?
usershare allow guests = yes	                        Allow non-authenticated users to access defined share?
map to guest = bad user	                                What to do when a user login request doesn't match a valid UNIX user?
browseable = yes	                                Should this share be shown in the list of available shares?
guest ok = yes	                                        Allow connecting to the service without using a password?
read only = yes	                                        Allow users to read files only?
create mask = 0700	                                What permissions need to be set for newly created files?

Dangerous Settings
Some of the above settings already bring some sensitive options. 
However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. 
In that case, we will see what advantages and disadvantages the settings bring with them. Let us take the setting browseable = yes as an example. 
If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual folders with the contents. 
Many folders are eventually used for better organization and structure. 
If the employee can browse through the shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.

Setting	                                                        Description
browseable = yes	                                        Allow listing available shares in the current share?
read only = no	                                                Forbid the creation and modification of files?
writable = yes	                                                Allow users to create and modify files?
guest ok = yes	                                                Allow connecting to the service without using a password?
enable privileges = yes	                                        Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?
create mask = 0777	                                        What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?
directory mask = 0777	                                        What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories?
logon script = script.sh	                                What script needs to be executed on the user's login?
magic script = script.sh	                                Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?
magic output = script.out	                                Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?


## Connecting to SMB 

SMBclient - Connecting to the Share
  SMB


Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

We can see that we now have five different shares on the Samba server from the result. Thereby print$ and an IPC$ are already included by default in the basic setting, as we have already seen. Since we deal with the [notes] share, let us log in and inspect it using the same client program. If we are not familiar with the client program, we can use the help command on successful login, listing all the possible commands we can execute.

Try to use two tools for enumeration incase the programming of the tools tell us two different things. 



## SMB Challenge 

Question 1 - What version of the SMB server is running on the target system? Submit the entire banner as the answer. - Samba smbd 4.6.2 

- probably two ways to go about it. i logged in via rpcclient and then ran the command 'netshareenumall' and recieved the answer. im running an nmap command to see if it will also tell us. - nmap -scV -A -p139,445 <IP> also told us. 

Question 2 - What is the name of the accessible share on the target? - sambashare 

- rpcclient + netshareenumall gave us this as well - sambashare 

Question 3 -  Connect to the discovered share and find the flag.txt file. Submit the contents as the answer. - HTB{o873nz4xdo873n4zo873zn4fksuhldsf}
A) smbclient //10.129.203.220/sambashare
B) smb: \> cd contents
smb: \contents\> ls
  .                                   D        0  Mon Nov  8 07:43:45 2021
  ..                                  D        0  Mon Nov  8 07:43:14 2021
  flag.txt                            N       38  Mon Nov  8 07:43:45 2021
C) smb: \contents\> get flag.txt
getting file \contents\flag.txt of size 38 as flag.txt (1.0 KiloBytes/sec) (average 1.0 KiloBytes/sec)
D) cat flag.txt on host machine. 


Question 4 - Find out which domain the server belongs to. - DevOps

Rpcclient -> enumdomains -> devops 

Question 5 - Find additional information about the specific share we found previously and submit the customized version of that specific share as the answer. - InFreight SMB v3.1

rpcclient -> netshareenumall -> remark: InFreight SMB v3.1 + path: C:\home\sambauser\

Question 6 - What is the full system path of that specific share? (format: "/directory/names") - C:\home\sambauser\

rpcclient -> netshareenumall -> remark: InFreight SMB v3.1 + path: C:\home\sambauser\


## be back tomorrow with NFS ( gross) and DNS and maybe SMTP too 



## 01/28/25 NFS Footprinting : ] 

# i rememgbher running into issues with the challenge on this one.. i forget why but lets see if we can tackle it. 

Network File System (NFS) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. 
Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. 
NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. 

NFS is based on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC-RPC/SUN-RPC) protocol exposed on TCP and UDP ports 111, which uses External Data Representation (XDR) for the system-independent exchange of data. 
The NFS protocol has no mechanism for authentication or authorization.

The most common authentication is via UNIX UID/GID and group memberships, which is why this syntax is most likely to be applied to the NFS protocol.



Default Configuration
NFS is not difficult to configure because there are not as many options as FTP or SMB have. The /etc/exports file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients. The NFS Exports Table shows which options it accepts and thus indicates which options are available to us.

Exports File
  NFS
Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
The default exports file also contains some examples of configuring NFS shares. First, the folder is specified and made available to others, and then the rights they will have on this NFS share are connected to a host or a subnet. Finally, additional options can be added to the hosts or subnets.

Option				Description
rw				Read and write permissions.
ro				Read only permissions.
sync				Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)
async				Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)
secure				Ports above 1024 will not be used.
insecure			Ports above 1024 will be used.
no_subtree_check		This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.
root_squash			Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, which prevents root from accessing files on an NFS mount.



ExportFS
  NFS
syntax: root@nfs:~# echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
syntax: root@nfs:~# systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server 
syntax: root@nfs:~# exportfs

/mnt/nfs      	10.129.14.0/24

We have shared the folder /mnt/nfs to the subnet 10.129.14.0/24 with the setting shown above. 
This means that all hosts on the network will be able to mount this NFS share and inspect the contents of this folder.

Dangerous Settings
However, even with NFS, some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure. Here are some of them listed:

Option					Description
rw					Read and write permissions.
insecure				Ports above 1024 will be used.
nohide					If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry.
no_root_squash				All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.


###Footprinting NFS

When footprinting NFS, the TCP ports 111 and 2049 are essential. We can also get information about the NFS service and the host via RPC, as shown below in the example.

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC

### Footprinting DNS


Globally distributed DNS servers translate domain names into IP addresses and thus control which server a user can reach via a particular domain. There are several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide:

DNS root server
Authoritative name server
Non-authoritative name server
Caching server
Forwarding server
Resolver

Server Type				Description
DNS Root Server				The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (TLD). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are 13 such root servers around the globe.
Authoritative Nameserver		Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.
Non-authoritative Nameserver		Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.
Caching DNS Server			Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.
Forwarding Server			Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.
Resolver				Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.


DNS is mainly unencrypted. Devices on the local WLAN and Internet providers can therefore hack in and spy on DNS queries. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption.

Different DNS records are used for the DNS queries, which all have various tasks. Moreover, separate entries exist for different functions since we can set up mail servers and other servers for a domain.

DNS Record				Description
A					Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain as a result.
AAAA					Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain.
MX					Returns the responsible mail servers as a result.
NS					Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain.
TXT					This record can contain various information. The all-rounder can be used, e.g., to validate the Google Search Console or validate SSL certificates. In addition, SPF and DMARC entries are set to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam.
CNAME					This record serves as an alias for another domain name. If you want the domain www.hackthebox.eu to point to the same IP as hackthebox.eu, you would create an A record for hackthebox.eu and a CNAME record for www.hackthebox.eu.
PTR					The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.
SOA					Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact.


## Dangerous Settings: 

Option					Description
allow-query				Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server.
allow-recursion				Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server.
allow-transfer				Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server.
zone-statistics				Collects statistical data of zones.

If the administrator used a subnet for the allow-transfer option for testing purposes or as a workaround solution or set it to any, everyone would query the entire zone file at the DNS server. In addition, other zones can be queried, which may even show internal IP addresses and hostnames.

The individual A records with the hostnames can also be found out with the help of a brute-force attack. To do this, we need a list of possible hostnames, which we use to send the requests in order. Such lists are provided, for example, by SecLists.

## DNS Challenge 


Question 1 -  Interact with the target DNS using its IP address and enumerate the FQDN of it for the "inlanefreight.htb" domain. -> dig any OR ns inlanefreight.htb @10.129.42.195 -> asnwer is in NS section -> ns.inlanefreight.htb



Question 2 -  Identify if its possible to perform a zone transfer and submit the TXT record as the answer. (Format: HTB{...}) -> dig axfr internal.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.42.195 -> HTB{DN5_z0N3_7r4N5F3r_iskdufhcnlu34}



Question 3 - What is the IPv4 address of the hostname DC1? -> also found with -> dig axfr internal.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.42.195 -> dc1.internal.inlanefreight.htb.	604800 IN A  10.129.34.16



Question 4 -  What is the FQDN of the host where the last octet ends with "x.x.x.203"? -> from our dig axfr we have a lot of sub domains, we have to run against all zones -> win2k.dev.inlanefreight.htb

## Going to move onto SMTP / IMAP/POP3 & SNMP tomorrow. going to finish a tryhackme room now. 

## Footprinting SMTP - Finished Smol room on THM now back @ this : ] 


By default, SMTP servers accept connection requests on port 25. However, newer SMTP servers also use other ports such as TCP port 587.
Under certain circumstances, a server uses a port other than the standard TCP port 25 for the encrypted connection, for example, TCP port 465.
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol for sending emails in an IP network. 
It can be used between an email client and an outgoing mail server or between two SMTP servers.
SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3 protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails. 


On arrival at the destination SMTP server, the data packets are reassembled to form a complete e-mail. From there, the Mail delivery agent (MDA) transfers it to the recipient's mailbox.

Client (MUA)	➞	Submission Agent (MSA)	➞	Open Relay (MTA)	➞	Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)	➞	Mailbox (POP3/IMAP)

an extension for SMTP has been developed called Extended SMTP (ESMTP). When people talk about SMTP in general, they usually mean ESMTP. ESMTP uses TLS, which is done after the EHLO command by sending STARTTLS.
This initializes the SSL-protected SMTP connection, and from this moment on, the entire connection is encrypted, and therefore more or less secure.


To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the telnet tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server. 
The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, HELO or EHLO.
