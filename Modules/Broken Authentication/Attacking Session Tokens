be sure to have entropy with your session tokens lololol ive realized this the hard way irl. bascically make them as random as you can and NON GUESSABLE 

CHALLENGE: Authenticate to 94.237.57.18:45466 with user "htb-stdnt" and password "AcademyStudent!"


Question 1 - A session token can be brute-forced if it lacks sufficient what? - entropy 


Question 2 -  Obtain administrative access on the target to obtain the flag.

1) authenticated with creds above 
2) once logged in -> right click to inspector -> storage -> grab cookie value 
3) in terminal -> echo '757365723d6874622d7374646e743b726f6c653d75736572' | xxd -r -p
output: user=htb-stdnt;role=user
4) so we wwant our role to be admin so were gonna reverse the above command to -> echo -n 'user=htb-stdnt;role=admin' | xxd -p
output -> 757365723d6874622d7374646e743b726f6c653d75736572
5) inside inspector -> storage -> cookies replace with value above then hit refresh on browser 
6) HTB{d1f5d760d130f7dd11de93f0b393abda}
