ðŸ”¥ What This Section Is Teaching You
You're pivoting from enumerating the database to abusing it as a foothold on the system. This is a red team escalation jump, using DBMS privileges to start treating the database like a file browser or command window.

ðŸ§  Concepts in This Section
1. Privilege Checking
SELECT USER() â†’ Who am I? (e.g., root@localhost)

SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user â†’ Am I a god?

SELECT grantee, privilege_type FROM information_schema.user_privileges â†’ What can I actually do?

If you have FILE privilege â†’ buckle up.

2. Reading Files with LOAD_FILE()
If the MySQL user and OS permissions allow it, you can:

Read /etc/passwd

Read /var/www/html/search.php

Read any file thatâ€™s world-readable or readable by the MySQL process

This is not just SQLi anymore â€” this is information disclosure + potential LFI escalation.

3. Why This Matters in the Real World
You can:

Steal SSH keys

Dump source code

Read .env files or config files with DB credentials or API keys

Leak full web app logic to chain into RCE

Expose credentials for other systems (pivoting potential)

ðŸ§  Mental Model:
Step	Goal	Example
SELECT USER()	Who am I in the DB?	root@localhost
SELECT super_priv	Am I superuser?	Y
SELECT grantee, privilege_type	What powers do I have?	FILE, SELECT, etc.
LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd')	Can I read files on disk?	Yes â†’ ðŸ§¨
LOAD_FILE('/var/www/html/index.php')	Can I dump PHP source code?	Jackpot
ðŸ§© In essence:
Yes â€” you nailed it again. This is taking everything youâ€™ve built so far with UNION injection and weaponizing it for system-level compromise, assuming you have:

The right SQLi vector

The right privileges

A file path to target

This is your whoami && net user /domain + net localgroup administrators phaseâ€¦ but inside a SQL environment instead of Active Directory.

ðŸŽ¯ You're doing:
âœ… Initial enumeration of your identity (USER())

âœ… Privilege audit like checking group membership (super_priv, user_privileges)

âœ… Capability mapping like Get-DomainUser -AdminCount 1 in AD â†’ here it's FILE, EXECUTE, etc.

âœ… Asset reconnaissance (LOAD_FILE() == reading C:\Users\Public\Downloads or C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config)

âœ… Prepping for pivot to something bigger â€” like code injection, credential dumping, or lateral movement if this DB talks to other services

ðŸ§  SQL DB as a Mini AD:
AD Mindset	SQL Equivalent
Who am I? â†’ whoami	SELECT USER();
What groups am I in?	SELECT * FROM user_privileges;
What can I touch?	LOAD_FILE(), writable dirs
Where can I pivot?	Web root, config files, DB creds, stored procs, outfile tricks
