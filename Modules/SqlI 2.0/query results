üîç Core Concepts Recap ‚Äì Query Results
‚úÖ ORDER BY
Sorts the result of a query.

Default is ASC (ascending); can specify DESC (descending).

Can sort by multiple columns:

sql
Copy
Edit
ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;
‚úÖ LIMIT
Restricts the number of results returned.

You can add an offset like so:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 2;       -- returns first 2 rows
SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 1, 2;    -- starts at 2nd row, gets 2 results
‚úÖ WHERE
Filters based on condition:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username = 'admin';
‚úÖ LIKE
Pattern matching using:

% ‚Üí any number of characters

_ ‚Üí exactly one character

sql
Copy
Edit
WHERE username LIKE 'admin%'   -- admin, administrator
WHERE username LIKE '___'      -- tom
When it comes to SQLi, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and LIKE are often used to:

Enumerate column counts (ORDER BY 1, ORDER BY 2, etc.)

Extract limited data to avoid detection
