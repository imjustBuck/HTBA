Password Spraying Considerations
While password spraying is useful for a penetration tester or red teamer, careless use may cause considerable harm, such as locking out hundreds of production accounts. One example is brute-forcing attempts to identify the password for an account using a long list of passwords. In contrast, password spraying is a more measured attack, utilizing very common passwords across multiple industries. The below table visualizes a password spray.

Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - Credentialed
As stated in the previous section, we can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured and whether or not we have valid domain credentials. With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as CrackMapExec (https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) or rpcclient.

now how about without creds? we could obtain the policy via SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind. 

SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy.

SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

When creating a domain in earlier versions of Windows Server, anonymous access was granted to certain shares, which allowed for domain enumeration. An SMB NULL session can be enumerated easily. For enumeration, we can use tools such as enum4linux, CrackMapExec, rpcclient, etc.

https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html -> we can use rpcclient to check DC for SMB NULL session access, once connected as can issue an RPC command such as querydomaininfo to obtain info abouty the domain.

We can also obtain the password policy. We can see that the password policy is relatively weak, allowing a minimum password of 8 characters.

Analyzing the Password Policy
We've now pulled the password policy in numerous ways. Let's go through the policy for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain piece by piece.

* The minimum password length is 8 (8 is very common, but nowadays, we are seeing more and more organizations enforce a 10-14 character password, which can remove some password options for us, but does not mitigate the password spraying vector completely)
* The account lockout threshold is 5 (it is not uncommon to see a lower threshold such as 3 or even no lockout threshold set at all)
* The lockout duration is 30 minutes (this may be higher or lower depending on the organization), so if we do accidentally lockout (avoid!!) an account, it will unlock after the 30-minute window passes
* Accounts unlock automatically (in some organizations, an admin must manually unlock the account). We never want to lockout accounts while performing password spraying, but we especially want to avoid locking out accounts in an organization where an admin would have to intervene and unlock hundreds (or thousands) of accounts by hand/script
* Password complexity is enabled, meaning that a user must choose a password with 3/4 of the following: an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character (Password1 or Welcome1 would satisfy the "complexity" requirement here, but are still clearly weak passwords).

The default password policy when a new domain is created is as follows, and there have been plenty of organizations that never changed this policy:

Policy	                                Default Value
Enforce password history	                24 days
Maximum password age	                    42 days
Minimum password age	                      1 day
Minimum password length	                      7
Password must meet complexity requirements	Enabled
Store passwords using reversible encryption	Disabled
Account lockout duration	                  Not set
Account lockout threshold	                      0
Reset account lockout counter after	        Not set

Whats next? 
Now that we have the password policy in hand, we need to create a target user list to perform our password spraying attack. Remember that sometimes we will not be able to obtain the password policy if we are performing external password spraying (or if we are on an internal assessment and cannot retrieve the policy using any of the methods shown here). In these cases, we MUST exercise extreme caution not to lock out accounts. We can always ask our client for their password policy if the goal is as comprehensive an assessment as possible. If asking for the policy does not fit the expectations of the assessment or the client does not want to provide it, we should run one, max two, password spraying attempts (regardless of whether we are internal or external) and wait over an hour between attempts if we indeed decide to attempt two. While most organizations will have a lockout threshold of 5 bad password attempts, a lockout duration of 30 minutes and accounts will automatically unlock, we cannot always count on this being normal. I have seen plenty of organizations with a lockout threshold of 3, requiring an admin to intervene and unlock accounts manually.

We do not want to be the pentester that locks out every account in the organization!
