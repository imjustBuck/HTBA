NMAP can help with all of the following use cases: 


Audit the security aspects of networks
Simulate penetration tests
Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations
Types of possible connections
Network mapping
Response analysis
Identify open ports
Vulnerability assessment as well.

Nmap can be divided into the following scanning techniques:

Host discovery
Port scanning
Service enumeration and detection
OS detection
Scriptable interaction with the target service (Nmap Scripting Engine)


NMAP syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ nmap <scan types> <options> <target>

## Host Discovery 

Scanning Netowrk Ranges 

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5 


Scanning Options	Description
10.129.2.0/24	    Target network range.
-sn	              Disables port scanning.
-oA tnet	        Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.


Scan Single IP
Before we scan a single host for open ports and its services, we first have to determine if it is alive or not. For this, we can use the same method as before.

  Host Discovery
Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.087s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
Scanning Options	Description
10.129.2.18	      Performs defined scans against the target.
-sn	              Disables port scanning.
-oA host	        Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.

If we disable port scan (-sn), Nmap automatically ping scan with ICMP Echo Requests (-PE). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an ICMP reply if the pinging host is alive. The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an ARP ping resulting in an ARP reply. We can confirm this with the "--packet-trace" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (-PE) for this.

  Host Discovery
Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:08 CEST

Scanning Options	Description
10.129.2.18     	Performs defined scans against the target.
-sn	              Disables port scanning.
-oA host	        Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.
-PE	              Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target.
--packet-trace	  Shows all packets sent and received

Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "--reason" option.

### HOST AND PORT SCANNING 

Information gathered by these scans: 

Open ports and its services
Service versions
Information that the services provided
Operating system


There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:

State	                    Description
open	              This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be TCP connections, UDP datagrams as well as SCTP associations.
closed	            When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an RST flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.
filtered	          Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.
unfiltered	        This state of a port only occurs during the TCP-ACK scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.
open|filtered	      If we do not get a response for a specific port, Nmap will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.
closed|filtered	    This state only occurs in the IP ID idle scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.

Discovering Open UDP Ports
Some system administrators sometimes forget to filter the UDP ports in addition to the TCP ones. Since UDP is a stateless protocol and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole UDP scan (-sU) much slower than the TCP scan (-sS).

Let's look at an example of what a UDP scan (-sU) can look like and what results it gives us.


Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU


Scanning Options	    Description
10.129.2.28	          Scans the specified target.
-F	                  Scans top 100 ports.
-sU	                  Performs a UDP scan.

If we get an ICMP response with error code 3 (port unreachable), we know that the port is indeed closed.


Version Scan 

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 445 --reason  -sV

Scanning Options	      Description
10.129.2.28	            Scans the specified target.
-Pn	                    Disables ICMP Echo requests.
-n	                    Disables DNS resolution.
--disable-arp-ping	    Disables ARP ping.
--packet-trace	        Shows all packets sent and received.
-p 445	                Scans only the specified port.
--reason	              Displays the reason a port is in a particular state.
-sV	                    Performs a service scan.


First Challenge in the nmap module has two questions: 

1  Find all TCP ports on your target. Submit the total number of found TCP ports as the answer. - 7 
 - From experience im going to start with nmap -sCV -A 10.129.201.105 and see the total we get from that, depending on the output it could also answer number 2. 

It did give us both answers - 7 open ports and hostname of NIX-NMAP-DEFAULT


2 Enumerate the hostname of your target and submit it as the answer. (case-sensitive) - NIX-NMAP-DEFAULT

#### Saving nmap results 

While we run various scans, we should always save the results. We can use these later to examine the differences between the different scanning methods we have used. Nmap can save the results in 3 different formats.

Normal output (-oN) with the .nmap file extension
Grepable output (-oG) with the .gnmap file extension
XML output (-oX) with the .xml file extension
We can also specify the option (-oA) to save the results in all formats. The command could look like this:

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target

Scanning Options	    Description
10.129.2.28	          Scans the specified target.
-p-	                  Scans all ports.
-oA target	          Saves the results in all formats, starting the name of each file with 'target'.

## Perform a full TCP port scan on your target and create an HTML report. Submit the number of the highest port as the answer.
- the Challenge for this one is a bit redundant since the highest number port comes up when we just simply run the command : 

nmap 10.129.201.105 -p- -oA target
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-25 12:04 CST

143/tcp   open  imap
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds
31337/tcp open  Elite

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.90 seconds


you would then just this command with a tool called xslproc: 

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ xsltproc target.xml -o target.html 

then open the html in a browser and you have your results. 


### Service Version

Service Version Detection
It is recommended to perform a quick port scan first, which gives us a small overview of the available ports. This causes significantly less traffic, which is advantageous for us because otherwise we can be discovered and blocked by the security mechanisms. We can deal with these first and run a port scan in the background, which shows all open ports (-p-). We can use the version scan to scan the specific ports for services and their versions (-sV).

A full port scan takes quite a long time. To view the scan status, we can press the [Space Bar] during the scan, which will cause Nmap to show us the scan status.

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV

Scanning Options	    Description
10.129.2.28	          Scans the specified target.
-p-	                  Scans all ports.
-sV	                  Performs service version detection on specified ports.


they kinda talk dribble in the middle of this section so we will skip to the challenge: 

 Enumerate all ports and their services. One of the services contains the flag you have to submit as the answer. - HTB{pr0F7pDv3r510nb4nn3r} 

starting with - nmap -p- -sCV -A 10.129.201.105 -> this is my goto nmap scan... i realize it wont always work esepcially with firewall and AV rules in place but its a good start.

I try to do things in a very simple manner... doesnt always work but doesnt hurt to try. 


## NSE AKA nmap scripting engine 


Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is another handy feature of Nmap. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services. There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:

Category	              Description
auth	                  Determination of authentication credentials.
broadcast	              Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.
brute	                  Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.
default	                Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.
discovery	              Evaluation of accessible services.
dos	                    These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.
exploit	                This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.
external	              Scripts that use external services for further processing.
fuzzer	                This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.
intrusive	              Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.
malware	                Checks if some malware infects the target system.
safe	                  Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.
version	                Extension for service detection.
vuln	                  Identification of specific vulnerabilities.


We have several ways to define the desired scripts in Nmap.

Default Scripts

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> -sC

Specific Scripts Category

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> --script <category>

Defined Scripts

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>,...

## Challenge - Use NSE and its scripts to find the flag that one of the services contain and submit it as the answer. - HTB{873nniuc71bu6usbs1i96as6dsv26}

this is actually a horrible worded question and after running a lot of NSE scripts... its just on http://10.129.201.105/robots.txt -> HTB{873nniuc71bu6usbs1i96as6dsv26}

Timing

Because such settings cannot always be optimized manually, as in a black-box penetration test, Nmap offers six different timing templates (-T <0-5>) for us to use. These values (0-5) determine the aggressiveness of our scans. This can also have negative effects if the scan is too aggressive, and security systems may block us due to the produced network traffic. The default timing template used when we have defined nothing else is the normal (-T 3).

-T 0 / -T paranoid
-T 1 / -T sneaky
-T 2 / -T polite
-T 3 / -T normal
-T 4 / -T aggressive
-T 5 / -T insane
These templates contain options that we can also set manually, and have seen some of them already. The developers determined the values set for these templates according to their best results, making it easier for us to adapt our scans to the corresponding network environment. The exact used options with their values we can find here: https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html

Default Scan

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default 

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 32.44 seconds

Insane Scan

Syntax: MJBUCKNER@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.T5 -T 5

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 18.07 seconds
Scanning Options	Description
10.129.2.0/24	Scans the specified target network.
-F	Scans top 100 ports.
-oN tnet.T5	Saves the results in normal formats, starting the specified file name.
-T 5	Specifies the insane timing template.
